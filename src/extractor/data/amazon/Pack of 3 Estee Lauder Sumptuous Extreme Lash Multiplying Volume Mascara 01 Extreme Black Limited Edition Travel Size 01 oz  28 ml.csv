"when estee lauder discontinued the navy blue mascara I resorted, in somewhat an act of protest, to tryinga  cheaper brand for the sake of maintaining my signature blue lashes - however, my eyes swelled up within 2 weeks of trying the off-brand - a hard-earned lesson solidifies my loyalty to this brand. 5 stars for my favorite makeup brand for performance, longevity and being easy on sensitive eyes. love it!",5.0
"Love love LOVE. My grandmother-in-law got me  this sample size from Dillard's three years ago at Christmas. I used it sparingly and saved it for special occasions, and I STILL have the original bottle (although it's a bit dry now)! When she gave me an Amazon gift card for this Christmas, I knew I needed mascara, and why not splurge a bit? When a single full sized bottle has slightly less than these three combined, and costs a bit more, this was the better deal! I could use a smaller amount, keep the other closed off from drying out, and waste less over the time it takes me to use them. Love it!",5.0
Wonderful mascara. One year ago I bought a set of 3 for$18.00.Why has it double in price in just one year?,4.0
Very creamy formula,4.0
"LOVE the smaller sized container. I have purchased the larger version from makeup counters in the past and much prefer the smaller packaging as the mascara does not clump over extended period. I am going on month #2.5 with my first tube. Priced at 3 for $15, even if it did start to clump, these three smaller containers would last much longer than the larger package (in total) and was about half the price.",4.0
"Loved this mascara at full size, and you'll like it if you are looking for a dramatic look.  Easily can make my lashes look fake with a couple of layers; however I never use up my mascara in the recommended 6 month period after first use, so these were the perfect size for how I use my mascara - sporadically and I like to switch up brands depending on the look I am going for.",5.0
"I love this mascara!  I have thin short lashes and it goes on nicely and makes them appear darker and much longer and thicker!  It stays on all day and I love buying it in this smaller size and quntity because I can have one in my makeup box, one in my purse, and one extra to have on hand.  Great mascara!!",5.0
Love it!,5.0
"These small versions do not seem to be as high quality as the regular store bought one, they are not close to being waterproof. I don't know if they are not authentic or it is a strategy of Estee Lauder, but would recommend to buy the big one instead of these.",2.0
"So glad to find these on line.  You only get one as sample in deptment store and now can get as many as like!  This product stays on all day and looks great on your lashes!  Glides on smooth, no stickiness!",5.0
Convenient size to keep at home or take with me.,5.0
"What I like about getting this size is they won't dry out as quickly as a regular size. And altogether you get a little more than the regular size. I really like this mascara too, it's my favorite.",5.0

Very disappointed in this product.  No difference in my lashes- looked like I did not apply any at all.  I am giving it away and will not buy this again.  Went back to the grocery store and bought a cheap brand that actually works.,2.0

"I LOVE THIS STUFF, BUT ITS NOT WATERPROOF. I VEERED OFF AND BOUGHT A MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCT AND I COULD FEEL HOW HEAVY IT FELT ON MY EYES AND IT WAS VERY IRRITATING.  I IMMEDIATELY WENT BACK TO THIS PRODUCT AND FELT THAT MY EYES COULD BREATH AGAIN. ITS LIGHT AND EASY TO APPLY, BUT IT DOES LEAVE LITTLE SPECKS, SO I HAVE TO CHECK IT REGULARLY.  I MOSTLY LOVE THAT IT COMES IN A SMALL 3 PACK SO THE TWO OTHERS STAY FRESH IN THE FREEZER UNTIL IM READY TO USE THEM.  MORE BANG FOR MY BUCK.",5.0

"I have tried them ALL and this is the absolute best!  Full volume and length with NO clumps.  I love this travel size because it never dries out, full size mascaras tend to dry out before you use the entire tube.  These are perfect.",5.0
