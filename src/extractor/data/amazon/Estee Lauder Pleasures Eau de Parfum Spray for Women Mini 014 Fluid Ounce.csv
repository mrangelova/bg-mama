Super bummed that I received this perfect little travel size and it had gone bad.  Smelled the way oil smells when it's turned.  $45 only to throw it away immediately.  URGH!,1.0

"The two bottles that I ordered I was aware were very tiny bottles because I read the reviews before purchasing them.  The price was very reasonable but the fragrance doesn't last very long on me.  This worked out good for me because it gives me a chance to try Estee Lauder's ""Pleasures"" fragrance before I purchase a full size bottle which is expensive.",3.0

When I got the second bottle of perfume it smelled wonderful just like my only smell!! Thank you so much I truly did not think that you would send me another bottle and a hand written note from the person that prepared it for shipment that they had opened the bottle and smelled it and it smelled good to them!! I do not know another company that would do that! I loved that! I will soon be needing another bottle and cannot afford to buy a large bottle my Pleasures! Thank you again!  DeAnna,5.0
