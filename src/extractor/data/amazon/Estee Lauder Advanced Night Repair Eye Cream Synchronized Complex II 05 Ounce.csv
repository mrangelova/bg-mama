Enough said, I'm going back to WATTS BEAUTY & PHILOSOPHY. Don't waste your 40-50 bucks on this item.",2.0

"I opened the parcel and when I saw the produce date , I was astonished. First one is in 2015, second one is in 2016. But it is a six-month-best use thing.So my experience told you guys when you received your night repair eye or you have yours at home,you have to look carefully on the produce date ! Or you will get mad when you realized it is a wrong one ! And I need the manager to give me an explanation.",1.0
"I have used this brand eye cream for 3 years, so I can tell this bottle I buy is a fake one! The flavor, the color and the quality are all different from the real one. I bought three bottles!One of them is already empty!I have some pictures to improve it!Be careful!!!!",1.0
"The department store where I originally got this told me it's suitable for day and night both, but I prefer something a little more moisturizing. 54, combination skin. I like it fine for day, as it doesn't interfere with makeup and mascara. I use a different Estee Lauder Eye Cream at night.",3.0
I get this for my boss every holiday and birthday that she has.  She swears by this eye cream and only this one.  She is 69 and her face looks incredible so I can't argue with its results.  I used it as well and I do like the thickness of it and I do think it would work if I used it religiously like she does.  She used it once a day she said when she first started years and years ago and now she does it twice because she feels like she is getting older.  She said she used to have a scar in between  her eyes and after using this it disappeared.Please let me know if my review helped in your decision making process one way or the other. =),5.0
"I've tried several eye creams and this one by far is the best! If your looking to reduce bags and/or wrinkles this one is a miracle cream. I'm 41 y.o. who has tried from cheap to expensive eye creams, I've had a difficult time finding one that actually works. This one was almost instant, by the 2nd day of using Estee Lauder my under eye puffiness was gone. Their is no scent, didn't leave my eyes itchy or burning in the a.m. I dab a little under each eye before bed. It's a little pricey but so worth it. I'll definitely be buying this again!",5.0

"I ordered two bottes of estee lauder night repaireye synchonized complex from this seller (southwesternstyle) and gave them to my mom. She never used that before and told us"" it's good but there is really little stuff in the bottle"". I thought it's because she used too much. Yesterday I just found the bottle I gave to my mom only has half bottle in it! I then only the second bottle and found it's totally empty!I just asked for a return from the seller today. I will update the response from the seller if I ever get one!If anybody is thinking buying anything from this seller, think twice!",1.0
"I have used this product for more than a decade and love it. But for some reason, when I order it through Amazon, it is a different color- pink instead of amber- and has a mild mildewy smell.

Love this stuff too. Been using forever,5.0
"This product is a free gift-with-purchase that the seller received! The side of the container says, ""a gift from Estée Lauder.""I feel swindled. In addition the skin under my eyes have broken out in a rash and are peeling from this product.I recommend that you DO NOT purchase from this seller.",1.0
Be aware this is the old formula bottle.Estee Lauder improved their formula a couple years ago and the new bottle cap is gold and it says Advanced Night Repair Eye Synchronized Complex II.You are better off buying on their website or at an Estee Lauder counter for $6 more .,1.0
"I bought the sample size version through EL Macy's and I have been desperate to get my new bottle in the mail and it's TERRIBLE!

So disappointed will never order EL from amazon again...lesson learned",1.0

"Thus far, this is the best eye product I have tried. Facial products tend to make my eyes sensitive so I have to assure that I'm not putting product too close to my eyes. So, I normally don't purchase eye creams. Luckily, my mother is a product woman who gets sick of product about halfway through containers. So, I get to try a lot of different products ranging from inexpensive to the most expensive marketed.For her, this eye cream is in her top 10 but not her favorite. Of the products I've tried, this is one of my top two. I notice the difference with each use. It also doesn't seem to irritate my eyes. For Estee Lauder, I highly recommend this, the brown jar serum, the Idealist and the cleanser in the blue tube.",5.0
I am a dude and I can tell you that my eyes are not that bad but it does enhance your eyes and make you not look so tired. After three days of using it I noticed great results but when you stop the next day you'll pay.,1.0

"Always go back to this eye cream! Have tried many others, and I must say this is the bomb. No tacky greasy feel, goes on smoothly. Helps plump eyes underneath and helps with the dark circles. Mind you some dark circles are allergy related and some are genetic. My super sensitive daughter can use this with no problem what so ever! Very happy and will continue to use this.",5.0
