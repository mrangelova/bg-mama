My favorite facial moisturizer. I've used it for many years.,5.0
So far it has been a very pleasant experience.  Great moisturizer and I believe it seems to be firming as advertised.  I will know more definitely how well it firms after I have used it over a longer period of time.  Pleasant fragrance and nice consistency.  It doesn't take a lot to do the job so that makes it financially a good buy.  I also use the day formula with SPF and like it also.,4.0
"Good morning,The Estee Lauder product I received in March 2015 is fake and I'd like Amazon to solve this issue and put my refund back into my credit card. I have been using this product for years and I know it very well but this one has different texture, smell even it has kind of mint scent that is not right. This is dissapointing and hope this will be solved asap.Thank you,",5.0
