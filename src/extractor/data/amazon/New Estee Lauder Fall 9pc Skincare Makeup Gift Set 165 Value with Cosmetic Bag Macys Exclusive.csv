"I purchased my first Estee Lauder product in the mid-1990's and have been using it ever since. It is by far the best skin care line I have ever used, and I've tried almost everything that Macy's sells. The Advanced Night Repair leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and it appears plumped and glowing versus dry and tight. I LOVE Estee Lauder products....try this sample gift pack yourself, you'll never use anything else.",5.0
"Lots of products in one purchase. Bought as gift for wife , she love it. case is nice to store and easily transported when we travel. So much easier for a guy to find and purchase here than to look around box store and hunt for it in the maze of makeup. Great quality as you would expect from an Estee Lauder named product. Recomend this to any guy needing a gift for his SO",5.0

"This was a outstanding purchase.  Have not used all the products as of this review, but have already ordered the Revitalizing cream.  A little bit goes a long way.  Would recommend this skincare makeup gift set to give to others or keep for yourself.  The cosmetic bag is roomy and designed nicely.",5.0

"Only cosmetic brand my momr has used in decades. She could easily buy it herself, but she allows me the easy choice annually at Christmas.  At almost 80 it always looks perfectly natural, easily applies, and generously last the whole year.  She loves tropical heat and humidity, but it never drips, smears, discolor, deform, or comes off until she removes it.  Each year's currently fashionable colors always match her complexion.  With another purchase, sometimes without, cost is small for even a small amount of make-up, but this is a large variety and count of fill sized lipsticks, mascaras, blushes, eyeshadows and pencils.",5.0
Don't like the lip sticks in this set or the eyeshadow but the creams and washes are great with the mascara.,4.0
I like this pack very much. All the bad reviews are people who go don't know how to read a product description very well. There are a few items that says random choice. Hello! TSTL.,5.0

"this item was a rip off. In the picture it looks like your getting alot for your money, and it would make a great christmas gift. I was totally embarrassed when my wife open up the gift and said this is a free gift bag, that is given out free when making a purchase of Estee Lauder products. The proof to this is that the items in the bag said on them, items not for sale. I have always trusted Amazon, but in the future I will definitely be more cautious when making my purchases.",1.0

"I just love all the products. I like the Modern Muse lotion. That smells so pretty. People have even commented on what a nice smelling perfume I have on. I just love it. and the mascara, eye shadows, etc. I always use Estee Lauder's product. I would recommend it to every woman to buy.",5.0

Even if not everything included... with out reading the details... the title of this post still says 10 piece set...EVEN when you count the bag I had 9 pieces.  8 beauty products.  So not 10... or am I supposed to count the cardboard box it was shipped in?What is the point of splitting of the original set?,1.0
Such a disappointment.  Picture is totally misleading.  Shame on you EL!,1.0
