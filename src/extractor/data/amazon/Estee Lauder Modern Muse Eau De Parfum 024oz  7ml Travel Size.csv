"I love this scent...I'm not sure how to describe it...rich, but not over powering...woodsy, yet floral - but not too sweet...musk, but not over done or '70's style! Then there is an after scent that reminds me of a wonderful, rich soap! The bottle is small, but much larger than many of the others I've tried...which is nice...it allows you to truly sample this lovely perfume before you spend a substantial amount on a full size bottle. You just can't go wrong with Estee Lauder!",5.0
This scent was not what I was expecting in a really good way!! It was subtle and sexy and I am impressed at how Estee Laudercontinues to build on the former foundations of success with they're new inventions of fragrance...Wonderful!!  And congratulationsto the folks behind the scenes formulating some really exquisite scents.,4.0
"pretty much of a rip-off, I received this same size when I bought another Estee Lauder perfume for FREE.  Love the scent tho.",2.0
"I love the fragrance of Modern Muse.  It is being worn all day and night and not being tired of.  It'a not too sweet and has a professional aroma. So if any women wants to look good, sound good, feel good, and SMELL GOOD also, try Modern Muse.  You'll definitely bepleased.  I am.Seesee Davisp.s.  An improvement on Modern Muse would be to have a spray attachment on the bottle, or have a cap that screws on. The cap  slides off the travel size I purchased.",3.0
"Has a very modern scent. Crisp and light. Wanted the travel size just to find out if I wanted the big bottle. Will be ordering more. The only problem I have is the top - it is not a spray, and the top does not screw down, it is just a stopper type. Do not think I would want to use this for travel unless it was in purse and placed upright.",4.0
"I rarely wear perfume, but a sample in a magazine caught my attention. I was really drawn to it. I put the sample away for a few days and brought it out periodically over the next 2 weeks to see if this was something I really wanted. It was!  Best pricing I found was on Amazon.",5.0
"I love the scent, but when I tried to take the cap off to spray it, the part that sprays the perfume was stuck to the cap and it nearly spilled everywhere. I still can't get the piece out of the cap without almost breaking it.",2.0
Best things come in tiny shapes and pieces. Delicious smell.. ðŸ‘Œ,5.0
"This is not a spray bottle, and I just don't see the practicality of a purse spray that you have to pour onto your fingertips and spread onto your skin.  Not convenient if there's not a nearby sink.",3.0
My favorite,5.0
"I haven't found a scent I could stand wearing in a very long time. When I got a sample of this, I found I enjoyed wearing it. It was very subtle. I was a bit afraid to go for a large bottle because in the past I found the full size versions are stronger than the samples. So I bought this mini size to give it a try. The scent is the same and I do like it very much. The bottle, however, is not what is pictured here and it doesn't have a spray. The only way to use it is to remove the top and splash it on myself. I find this inconvenient and I'm even more annoyed by the product I received because it seems like a bait and switch. I'd buy a big bottle but not here, because I don't know what I'd get.",3.0
