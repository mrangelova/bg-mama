I was shocked at the coverage & how flawless it makes you look. I will be buying this one over  and over again in the future .,5.0

I am dealing with some dark spots post pregnancy and this is GREAT coverage.  Doesn't take much at all and I am able to target the areas that need the coverage.  Can look heavy at times but overall VERY pleased with this and it has become my every day go to foundation.,5.0
Absolutely the BEST. I am a singer and am under hot stage lights.. not to mention having hot flashes on top of that so my face sweats terribly and this stuff does not budge!! It is so beautiful and has complete coverage without looking thick and muddy. I have used them all and I couldn't live without this!! I am 45 and 20 year old daughter who also wears expensive makeup couldn't believe how well she liked it too. She just knew it was going to be old fashioned and thick but it makes you look flawless!,5.0
"It is a heavy make up.  I knew that when i purchased this product.  What I didn't expect was it to look like caked on make up.  Does not look natural, does not apply to face very well, even when using primer underneath.  For being a heavy make up it didn't cover my blemishes.  The color has a bit of an orange tint to it, wanted a lighter color but their selection is very limited.",2.0
"Wow, where has this been all my life? It goes on flawlessly with a stippling brush. I also use primer and a setting spray, but its amazing, and lasts all day. I'm pretty sure it would last all night too if I didn't wash it off, so if you're planning on going out and having a late night I would definitely wear this. Also, its very matte and dries quickly. IVE ALWAYS worn powder over my liquid foundation, and I have mildly oily skin, and I do not feel the need to wear powelder with this. That something I never dreamed I'd say. This product is 100% worth the money, and pea size amount is enough for my entire face.",5.0
"I love this make-up! Awesome coverage - i have melasma, and this is the only make-up that  actually covers it and lets me look like a normal person. However, i bought mine at Macys for only $37.00 - Amazon is more expensive for some reason, so check prices. But this make-up is light - i dont feel like im wearing stage make up at all, but it covers so well and is matte for my greasy face.",5.0
"I really like the foundation! I was surprised at how well it covered. I can re apply after 5 hours, I mean nothing last forever, but its worth the money to me and I will re order! :)P.S. I use it on dark spots and dark circles under my eyes. That has always been hard to cover!",5.0
This gives good coverage but looks very heavy on my skin. I no longer use it because it accentuates pores so much. I tried all kinds of primer but was not successful in making the product look more natural. It is also very yellow.,3.0
This extra coverage evens out skin tone and covers scars very well. I really like this one.,5.0
"I ordered this product a few weeks ago and I really like it. A little goes along way. I have always liked Estee Lauder products and especially their foundations. Worth the money, and I have tried EVERYTHING! I still always come back to Estee Lauder foundations.",5.0
Great coverage! A little goes a long way. Covers my hated melasma.,5.0
"The best foundation, hands down......expensive but worth it for the wearability, longevity and high quality all around.",5.0
"Thus stuff is phenomenal for a 40 + ur old woman with roseaca! MUST USE LOTS OF MOISTERIZER or the wrinkles will show, blend well! When have you been all my life?",5.0
"Great coverage for redness, scars, acne although it can clogg pores little if you don't clean it off well afterwards for acne prone skin. But, its my first choice even with acne as it can stay on in water with a sealer. I purchased a waterproof spray product to go in my Luminesse misting makeup spray & it worked great. (I forgot the name of product but it was not luminess, I just use misting system with it). Makeup held up through swim season & covering acne all summer. My only complaint is that as it gets older, the colors change to a weird color & becomes chalky. It's useless at that point & we buy new. Also we found ways to put on moisturizer first to get it to spread on better, then makeup, then sealer, if waterproof is the goal. When used regularly, I would use your favorite moisturizer over buying the Estee Lauder primer. Hope review helps someone.",4.0
"wish it would conform to natural color change, to dark in winter months",5.0
Awesome full-coverage foundation! Still trying to find the right color for me but can't imagine using any other foundation in the future!,5.0
I've used this foundation for years. The trick for flawless coverage (for me) is to apply it with a damp cosmetic sponge.,5.0
Only thing I don't like is it is a little yellow on me and I can't find a good foundation remover.  Perfectly Clean doesn't remove all of it either.  What to use????,5.0
Best foundation I every bought.  Covers every flaw.  Only apply once in the morning last all day.,5.0
"I have wore this for about 20 years... it is in fact a great produtc. The one thing I don't understand is why do they have to sell for $48 (including S+H), when the price on the Estee lauder offial site ( and also in Stores like Macy's) is 33.95.... I would think it before buying it here....",5.0
Best full coverage you can get.  You only need a tiny bit.  Move fast because it dries quickly and after is not blendable.  It is very matte.,5.0
Love this stuff! Great coverage. Can go on thick if you do t use a moisturizer underneath.,5.0
"This is the best makeup.  It makes your complexion look like it is flawless. One tip: if you have dry skin, put on a good moisturizer first. You can use a primer but I don't find much difference when I do.  I give it four stars instead of five because it can be a little dry for mature skin without a serious moisturizer.",4.0
"I can't find this in the stores anymore, so I'm VERY happy with my purchase.  Not over-priced either.",5.0
A little goes a long way! As long as I only use a drop it works perfect!,5.0
"Great makeup with excellent coverage, especially for a cream makeup in a tube. I use it to help conceal acne scars and blotchiness. A little goes a long way so one tube lasts much longer than most other high coverage foundations I've used in the past (like Mac). But I'm perplexed at the extreme overprice of $68 on Amazon. I paid $36 at my local Belk, which is the price listed on Macy's site. $68 is almost double the typical price. ??",5.0
The coverage is amazing.  You don't need very much to cover.  I was very surprisedto see how it covered and evened out my complexion,5.0
"I am happy with the product, small bottle for being so pricy, it transfers to my clothes, and skin tones should be broader but my skin looks great. I wish I could buy it here in my country.",4.0
"I never write reviews for anything, but this make-up deserves 10 stars!  This has helped hide my melasma/acne scars etc. all day long!  It's really pricey but a little goes a long way.  Love this stuff :)",5.0
"This is the best make up ever.. I have melasma ""mustache"". I tried dermablend thinking it would be better, but nothing is better than this. Awesome makeup.. not heavy..looks natural",5.0
"I keep coming back to this foundation after trying just about everything on the market from Chanel to Revlon. Mixing this foundation with a primer works well, as you can make it heavy, medium, or light coverage. The packaging is perfect for travel, takes up less room and is light weight. Also, I can get by without a concealer when wearing the Double Wear Maximum Coverage. When boating, I mix this foundation with a waterproof sunscreen and get a nice, long wearing coverage that works in the hot Florida sunshine.",5.0
Very cakey full coverage foundation. I bought this in hopes to cover some dark spots from melasma on my cheeks with no success. You only need a pinpoint amount to cover both cheeks but even then you can still see the dark spots through the makeup. Wish i had not missed the return date since it was so expensive and i will never be able to use.I've had better luck with coverage using a little dermablend and chanel concealer on top of it.,1.0
Love it except feels a dry.,5.0
"This is slightly lighter than I expected for creamy tan, but it covers great. I would definitely buy this product again.",4.0
"This stuff is AMAZING! It gives a full coverage and only takes a very little bit. Your skin looks flawless. I have not used a whole tube yet, so I can't say how long a tube will last. It's creamy and spreads so easily on my face. I am a new fan!",5.0
