"The photo here is deceiving because you DO NOT GET ALL OF THE ITEMS IN THE PHOTO. If you read the description, it tells you exactly what you get, so yes, TECHNICALLY, I was told. I got it for my Mom's birthday since I live in another state. Disappointingly, she did not get exactly what I was expecting. She texted me an image of what she got.",1.0

I bought this for my mom as a x-mas and everything was there the problem i had was that the little face cream was open and nothing was in it thank god the big 1 closed and full im just not happy paying for something thats open and has no product inside,1.0
When i got my order and open it i was surprised to see just three cream one eye shadow and one lipstick. I was looking to get what the picture was showing. I am send it back,1.0
I like the brand but was hoping it was something different than i tems I have already tried.,3.0
"Even though the picture shows a ton of stuff, it does mention what you're getting when you buy it very clearly in the description, which is detailed about a random selection of the product chosen. My bag was created perfect, they did a night cream, eye cream and day cream which completely makes sense! I'm very happy with it, this product would normally be more costly.",5.0
The eye cream container was almost empty,1.0
"Only 6 sets inside, one eye shadow, one lipstick, not as picture showed.",1.0

"Huge letdown! itty bitty products and a cheap bag. You're basically paying for a pink and black vinyl bag because the contents are microscopic in size.  Purchased for my wife for Christmas, was very embarrassed.",1.0
"Very nice make up bag, creme is great, eyecolors vivid and useful for different occasions, lipstick vivid and bright, yet the color is good even for day make up to go to work, the cosmetic bag is big, so probably will fit all your daily needs ;)",5.0
As a former artist for the Estee Lauder company ...Don't buy this.... I'm 99.9% sure this is a free gift with purchase product,1.0
this is what you get for free if you buy a makeup kit from macys or dillards so not worth it,3.0
It is lacking... And the lipstick is damaged!!!,1.0
Absolutely terrible. Less then 1/2 of what's in the picture actually came in the mail. I love Est√©e Lauder but this was a huge rip off. Very disappointing.,1.0
sounds like real,4.0
Only 6 pcs ...not 7...picture is very misleading as to what you actually get - avoid,1.0
Looks and smells like something that came out of a chinese $.99 store... Not worth it,1.0
