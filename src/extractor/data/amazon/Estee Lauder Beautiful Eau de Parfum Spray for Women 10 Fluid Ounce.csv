"I get this perfume for my mom every year, all the stores in my little town do not sell it anymore.. I have went two towns over to buy this for her the last two Christmas's. This year I ordered it 5 days shy of Christmas Eve and crossed my fingers hoping it would get here in time.... the delivery date estimated it would be late..... Wrong!! it arrived the 23!!! I was sooooo happy. Packaging was in perfect shape too!! Thanks Amazon!!",5.0
I purchased this perfume spray a few times from Amazon already. Always get compliments on this mild  fragrance. Will continue to buy it!,5.0
"bought it for my wife for the 3rd time, a good one",5.0
Good price for size.,5.0
This perfume is named appropriately.  I have loved it since it first came out!!!  The size I ordered is a small purse size spray so I can tale it with me anywhere.  I vacillate between this lovely scent and Elizabeth Arden's 5th Avenue and always get compliments on them.  But I love Beautiful so much I ordered two purse sizes!,5.0
The box this comes in reads 'Made in Switzerland' on the second to the last line. 'Beautiful' is Made in the USA.  This smells nothing like the perfume I know and love.Bravo to the Amazon Customer Service Rep who swiftly refunded my purchase and will report this problem.,1.0
"I should have listened to the other reviews, this does not smell like Beautiful & must be some knock off in good packaging, very disappointing. Don't waste your money!",1.0
"this is not the ""Beautiful"" I've been wearing for years! Don't waste your money.",1.0
"I have ordered this product previously through Amazon and had not problems.  This time the perfume does not smell like it's suppose to smell.  I took it to an Estee Lauder counter at a department store and had them check it.  It is NOT Beautiful.  I don't know if it's a knock off or an imitation, but it was not advertised to be, or I would never have purchased it.",1.0
I bought the sample Estee Lauder kit for my wife and this was my favorite so I bought a bottle.....just for her.....and me.....,5.0
"Scent is weaker than it should of been, I've been wearing Beautiful for 15 years and I knew something was off with the strength right away, but I think the problem is with Estee Lauder, because I ordered another bottle from their website and the scent was also weaker than usual.",2.0
"I'm not a perfume expert but I'm pretty sure something was off.  It does not smell like the original.  The bottle I received, to nicely put it, stinks.  The scent gave me a headache.",1.0
"I am pretty sure I got a fake perfume.My fiance really wanted this for Christmas, and I can't stand the smell. I don't know but the package seems a little off so not sure if it is real thing but also this stuff is stinky, if you are wanting something to smell nice, please save humanity and go a different route.Take my word ladies test the smell in store because not sure if fake or not but this stuff stinks.",1.0
"It's nice to find something that's feminine and slightly spicy. I usually don't like warm, spicy scents and find them overwhelming- but this fragrance is subtle and has plenty of light notes to balance the heavier ones. I received this as a gift and love it. I'd never worn it before. I also like that it smells nostalgic- I was a kid in the 80s and I remember smelling this perfume.",5.0
I have used Estee Lauder for years. I can tell that this is a fake not the real perfume.I would not order again from this company.,1.0
"Shipped quickly and it was the real deal.  Was skeptical, but for unfounded reasons.  I will purchase from here again!",5.0
Nice gift!,5.0
"Love this floral fragrance!. It takes me back to my heyday, but holds the test of time. And guys totally dig this scent! Great price, too.",5.0
"This is like old and has lost its original scent. I don't want to throw it away, but it is not like a new bottle.",2.0
"Although the fragrance is exactly what I ordered, I did not realize the small (1 oz) size of the bottle.  I'm sending it back; as it is soooo over-priced.",1.0
"My Mom was givin this for her birthday when it first came out in 1986. She'd always spray a little on me  before school. I used it for years before Knowing by Estee lauder came out, and  now use both. To me it has a summery floral smell. I use it along with Knowing by Estee lauder. I think i like the perfume better than the other  forms of the fragrance as it can  become too floral. I  use these 2 fragrances exclusively, and always get complements on them. I try to stay with 3 or so perfumes, and switch them out regularly as people tend to associate perfume with people or events. So this one along with Knowing will be 2 of my top 3 perfumes.",4.0
"I just received this and tried it today, I have worn Beautiful for 10 years, never anything else.When perfume is too old it smells diffrent, I TOTALLY wasted my money, OLD and smelld bad!!!  UGH!!!",1.0

"I love the smell, mild and feminine. Didn't think this one will pass the fragrance smell as others were disappointing, but I love its fragrance. It is long-lasting and I don't think it will be nauseating to others. This item says made in Switzerland and I am pleased with the purchase.",5.0
