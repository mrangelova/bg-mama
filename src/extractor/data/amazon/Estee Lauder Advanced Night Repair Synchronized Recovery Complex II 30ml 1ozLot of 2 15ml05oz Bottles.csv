I have used this product for years.  It leaves my face feeling soft and moist.  Gives it a healthy look and minimizes fine lines.  I let it take a few minutes to absorb into skin and then moisturize.,5.0

I like it a lot. I'm not sure if it has done what I expectd but my expectations might have been high.  Certainly over time there is a difference in skin color and conformity.,4.0

"I have to be honest here, I was very disappointed. It was runny and did not do much for me unless I used half the bottle.",2.0
"Maybe itâ€™s just me, but I do not like the scent of this product. It isnâ€™t repulsive by any means, but I find it strange. The formula is liquid, but not runny, and it doesnâ€™t feel oily or greasy on my skin. It absorbs quickly, and my skin feels very soft and moisturized after use. I must say however - if you are an ingredient conscious person I do NOT recommend this product. There are a few ingredients which are questionable. Most notably, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, which is limited in levels by the FDA, but it is a known endocrine disruptor and has been linked to breast cancer. Iâ€™m sure the amount in this product is at or below the limit of 7.5% by the FDA, but why take a chance? This is one of the ingredients that is recommended to avoid use whenever possible. Then again, if youâ€™re not someone who cares much about ingredients, then I see no issue with the formulaâ€™s feel and moisture!",2.0
I have used this product for several years. I'm always being told I look younger than I am. I was asked for my i.d. at Costco  recently to buy wine. Never before has this happened.  Not bad for a 59 year old woman. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†,5.0
"with just one application, u can see and feel the difference. your skin looks hydrated. i first tried in the morning, but noticed that my face was a bit oily after a few hours, but then again i live in tropic country and also tried a new brand of moisturizer and sunblock (olay regenerist and avene sunblock), but after i blotted, my face looks fresh again. I guess, for me it would be ideal to use it only at night.one thing i didnt like with this size and packaging, though its good for travelling, is that it has no dropper, u have to be extra careful not to accidentally dispense too much or spill any drop of this goody. other than that i love this and cant wait to see how it would shrink my pores, and refine my skin :)",5.0
I think these might have been expired or something; I've used this full-sized before and it worked versus these which did nothing.,2.0
I first received it as a sample in a beauty box and loved it. I dont think it is going to help with wrinkles or deep line but is goos for keeping the under eye moisturized and also prevents under eye puffiness. Next time I will prefer the pump bottle as I first got in sample as the product in these bottle appears to be thinner in consistency.,4.0
I've used Night Repair since it first came out in the early 80s.  I'm 67 years old and people think I'm in my 40s.  I couldn't live without it.,5.0
