"I bought this powder for my Mother. She's always used Youth Dew. It's what her Mother used, and my Mother inherited her old powder box after she passed away. She's always just refilled it with the powder from the set that she gets every year for Christmas, which comes in a small plastic container, but her Mother's box was falling apart and she was really sad about it. She was so, so excited to see that this was exactly like her Mother's box. She kept the old box for sentimental reasons but is now using this one daily for her powder. She also really likes the puff that it comes with, because it's larger than the one that comes with the set.Youth Dew is a very nice, light scent and I can't imagine my Mother smelling any different! This is a great price for this big box of powder, and will last her a very long time. She can generally make one of the smaller plastic containers last nearly a year!",5.0
"I used to buy this scent all the time.  I loved it so much and always got compliments about the scent.  This is the first time I ordered it again after a long time and it just doesn't smell the same!  Maybe it's me and my ""smeller"" has changed?  Can't figure it out.  I am going to try this scent again in the lotion.  We shall see!!!!",3.0
The smell is pleasing without being overpowering. It is incredibly helpful during the hot months of summer.,5.0
"I love the scent because it stays with me for a long time.  Also, another thing I like is that I can leave the lid open all the time, with the dusting powder puff facing out.  I leave it this way because it makes my bathroom have a delightfully fresh, sweet smell.",5.0
"Loved it originally as a gift.  But found department store in our area stopped selling it saying it was discontinued.  So happy to find it on Amazon.  Fragrance is light and subtle not overpowering.  Rather elegant & refreshing, I'd say.  As long as it's sold, I'm buying. Thank You.",5.0
the outer box was very nice but the inner box is just cardboard with a hole in it the plastic piece came off and left sticky residue around where I use the sponge to get the powder.  Was not happy with the inside box at all,2.0
"Only dusting powder left on the market as far as I know. My Mum used it, so I still want to use it.Keeps body dry and smooth, clothes slid on easily and don't cling.Soft scent, all day.",5.0
Have used this product for years. It is so convenient to have it arrive right at my door instead of having to stand at a counter at a department store.  Did take a little longer to arrive than going to the store but the convenience more than made up for it.,5.0

"My wife loves this powder.  She's used it for over 30 years.  The local department store stopped caring it since they renovated and had to cut back on a number of items.  We went on line to order it.  The cheapest that we found it was direct from Estte Lauder...almost 13 dollars cheaper than the vendor on Amazon.  If Amazon had carried it, the price would have been even lower.",5.0

"I have been wanting some scented powder for the longest time. I chose this powder based on the reviews - respectfully I say this smells like a great grandmothers perfume, and not in a good way. It just has that smell of mothballs, and too strong of a perfumy old smell. I'm glad some people like this, its just literally makes me nauseous.",2.0

"I bought 2 of these powders, thinking that being Estee Lauder, the smell would be nice, on the contrary, its odor is similar to talc saved many years, very sad, because not able to return because where I send these products is where I spend one week on vacation and did not give me chance but just having them UNUSED",2.0
"This powder is silky soft with a heavenly scent! It's not over-done but it stays for a long time.It's great to use after a shower, especially during hot weather, because it works well instead of using a tacky deodorant to keep dry and smelling fresh.Bought through Estee will cost you about $36 which includes tax and free shipping. It took me all of 5 minutes to order it from them online. It takes 5-7 business days to get to you.For purchases made for Estee products, I recommend skipping Amazon and going straight to Estee; you won't be disappointed! (This info just saved you about $15!)",5.0
I have been using this since I was a teenager and I am 87 now. It's the only scent I like.,5.0

"This powder smells great and feels great on your skin after a bath.  Wonderful to help you dry faster and feel feminine afterwards.  The scent has begun to linger on my clothes because I wear it so often, even after laundering, and my closet smells awesome as a result.I've worn Estee Lauder Youth Dew since the 1970s, when it was a favorite with my mother.  Be sure to pair this powder with the matching Youth Dew perfume. It smells beautiful at any age, and the unique bottle looks great on your dresser.  Rich, clean, sweet scent.",5.0
"But sorry too say I believe my Estee Lauder dusting powder Youth Dew was old and was darken in color and did not have the wonderful SMELL,  I was so disappointed !!!! I had already thrown the box and carton it came in so could not return it or I would have.thank you for listing to me",1.0

"Wonderful, as expected!  I mix two powders, this one & Shalimar.  Perfection!",5.0
"This was bought for me as a gift when I was 18.  Even though it is called ""Youth Dew,"" at that time I remember it smelling very mature, yet feminine.  I associated it with something an older person would wear.  I don't think it was really for me at the time, although it's a classic scent and certainly lovely.",4.0
"I work outdoors in the hot summer greeting people.  Even after a 10 hour day in the heat people still ask what I am wearing.I use the Youth Dew bath oil and the powder.  The bath oil worn as a perfume smells better and better as the heat of the day gets warmer and warmer.All day people tell me how good I smell, and I love that!",5.0
