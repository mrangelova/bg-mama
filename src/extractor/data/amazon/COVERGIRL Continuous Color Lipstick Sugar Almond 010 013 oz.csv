Yucky. The mauve looked like a papaya colored shade and I did not like the formula. It is very creamy but not very long lasting.  I felt like the formula made the lines in my lips more obvious. I can understand how others might prefer it. Just not for me.,2.0
"This is a shade of lipstick I have worn for many years.  I was glad to find it on Amazon (at a great price) because it's not always easy to find in the store.  This is a very creamy, rich feeling lipstick without being greasy.  It's shimmery without being sparkly or iridescent.  I recommend this as well as the Ice Blue Pink for a light pink sheen and soft feel.  I get compliments on it all the time.",5.0
"I’m a senior lady and enjoy being able to find this lipstick on line.  It’s my basic tint, tho I do sometimes change.  I find ordering on Amazon very convenient, saving me trips where I may not locate the color I want.  Cover Girl products are reliable and the price is fair.",5.0
"Best Lipstick ever, can only get it online. OK because it's less expensive on Amazon - Thanks!",5.0
I would say my lips are generally pretty moist and not dry. I applied lip balm before the lipstick and my lips still dried out and started peeling! Disgusting,1.0

Best color ever offered by Covergirl. It looks good on a multitude of people and colorings. Love it!,5.0
I really love this lipstick!  Too bad I can't find it in CVS anymore.,5.0
"This color is hard to find, so we got a few when they popped up on Amazon as an add-on. The color is pretty and can be easily made lighter or darker with repeat swipes, unlike other colors that look odd if they are applied with a heavy hand. The color wipes off pretty easily and will need to be reapplied throughout the day.",5.0

This lipstick went on smoothly and lasted a long time. Wonderful!!!,5.0
"This is a Wonderful  color, light enough to lessen a darker color, and yet, dark enough to be something all on it's own!  I use this with City Lips Lip Plumper (which Is AMAZING!!) Clear w/Sparkle.  This lipstick is smooth and has no real fragrance or taste, which is important to me.",4.0

I love this color. It is very complementary to a 60 year old woman with medium light skin. It is the color of rosy lips and looks great with all colors of clothing.,5.0
it's not as smooth as other lipstick I have in that it doesn't cover the lines on my lips and kind of amplifies it.,4.0

"This is the best color I've ever found and wish Cover Girl had not discontinued it, which is why I have to keep looking for it on the internet.  It has a lovely pink/light rose tone with hint of lavendar, and it has a frosted sheen.  I've hunted all over for other manufacturers which might have a matching color, to no avail.  I hope Amazon keeps finding a way to offer it at a reasonable price.",5.0
"Great color, stays on nice! Moistens lips.",5.0

love it,5.0
"The color is perfect! Unfortunately, the stick broke in the tube the third time I used it.",3.0
This was a very nice color on me. Loved it.,5.0
"The base color is a light pink, almost like a nude but it's primary feature is an almond-like shimmer. Way too much shimmer in my opinion for my age, 30, or preference. It applies well, covers well, and wears like an average, cheaper lipstick. Keep it with you throughout the day. Continual application is necessary. If you want to shine ""like a diamond"", you might like it.",3.0
"I have been using this lipstick for years all the while trying other newer versions (both expensive and inexpensive) and have found this to be the BEST of the BEST. I have figured out that by applying liquid makeup base to my lips, then lipliner, then the lipstick and the final step applying a powder base, it will stay in tact and does not look dry or crumbly. It looks natural and just gorgeous. Now... if only they would make this lipstick in a sexy shade of red, I would be the happiest gal on earth. :o)",5.0
"I need a lipstick that I can re-apply without a mirror.  This is a perfect color for me, so I ordered 4 more!",5.0
"The color isn't what I expected, too pink, and it has chemical taste.",3.0
"I thought this lipstick was a pretty color in the tube, but on me, it was too frosty.  All I could see was the whitish aspect--like something from 1970.  I only applied it once and threw it away.  It may be great on other people, but wasn't at all flattering on me and I have pale skin.",3.0
"love this lipstick; been wearing it and this color for ten years:) do NOT discontinue please!!!! It is a really light color, but when you put a darker lip liner with it, it is totally a beautiful mix:) I was 45 when I started using it, just turned 56:)",5.0
Striking color. Very fresh and youthful.,5.0
"I didn't really like this color. It was much shinier than I expected. From the picture it looked more like a matte beach, but this was definitely very glossy. It only lasts on me for maybe an hour or two before I have to reapply, but that's pretty much every lipstick ever made.",3.0
"Stays on for so long!! The color is beautiful, too.",5.0
This is my favorite Cover girl lipstick and wouldn't you know it Walmart stopped carrying it.  Thankfully I found it here on Amazon and purchased several of them.  I put the lipstick on before I leave for work and it last until lunch time which is 6 hours later.  It keeps my lips soft and I just love the color.  It goes with everything.,5.0
This is a great product. I love the color.,5.0
"I love this color... I was finding it difficult to locate it in any other brands. Revlon would not ordinarily be my first choice, as it is a little drying. And I usually buy more health store oriented products..but this color works really well for me.. So I keep 'em coming!",5.0
Its perfect.  I love this color and can no longer find it in any of the stores near my house. It got here really fast also!!,5.0

"I have been looking for a shade of lipstick that still looked ""natural"" yet elegant. My skin tone is about a medium but my lips are very pale (they have almost zero color to them; being anemic doesn't help either) but this shade of lipstick came out so beautiful, it complimented my skin tone beautifully and it went on ever so smoothly. This color isn't harsh nor is it too light, it was perfect for what I wanted.",5.0
"nice color, not too wet looking.  i am so sick of that big, wet pouty look.  stays on for quite a while and isn't goopy.  the color matches your lips and mine, pretty much everyone's lips.",5.0

"Light, smooth, and a decent buy.  Some colors are simply too glaring or too greasy feeling IMO.  This product is one of preference rather than quality.  Either you like the taste or do not, you like the texture or not like it, you appreciate its light shade or wasn't glaring color.  I prefer subtle shade myself.",4.0
"I use to purchase this color all the time when I was able to find it in stores near me, but the color seems to have become a bit darker, which I don't like. Besides the package being a bit beat up, it was delivered in an acceptable time.",3.0
only problem was that I applied for the chase credit card and these items should not have cost me anything...  to get the credit card I was supposed to have been given a $30.00 credit.  I just received a bill from chase for the $19.99????,5.0

I have dark hair and a fair complexion, but this was far too light for me.  I have given it 4 stars because it feels good to wear, and I'm sure it has 'staying power', but the color was not for me.  I will try other colors, but perhaps not online.",4.0

It arrived quickly and I'm happy with my purchase.",5.0

I particularly like this color and the lipstick is perfect ...I do have a complaint about the container.......the plastic top on every single purchase cracks easily and I do not understand why this product cannot have a cover that holds up better than this one ...Everything else works .....the cover is 100% defective on every tube I have ever purchased and I have purchased many!

"These two lipsticks (Rose Quartz and Bronzed Peach) have been discontinued by Covergirl.

This lipstick lasts on the lips and and such a beautiful frosty shine to it.  I just wish CoverGirl would remake this product.",5.0
"Yes, seeing the color was named 'Rose Quartz' was the main reason I bought it along to see if I can pull off a lighter pink lipstick. Rose Quartz is only of my favorite gemstones and was surprised that Covergirl had a lipstick named after it. I've been a fan of Covergirl's concealer and had not tried out their other products.When I tried the lip stick, the shade was what I was expected but it was a lot shimmer than I realized. It looked like it was a mix of pink and silver, it was unexpected and took me a few extra minutes to get used to. The main reason I'm just giving it 3 stars is because of the fell. I'm not sure if it is just this color or lipstick or it's all Covergirl's lipstick, but it felt like it would easily come off and that I have to reapply after tn minutes of wearing.",3.0
"This shade is perfect for my complexion (dark brown hair and pale skin). It's a lovely healthy natural colour. I would have given it 5 stars if it had lasted a bit longer on my lips, but at this price, its a pretty good buy. I recommend this product.",4.0

"I've worn this shade of Cover Girl lipstick for 15 years...it's tried and true. I'm a beauty junkie so I've experimented with different lipsticks through the years - nothing is better than this shade. It's the best pink frosted lipstick on the market - hands down. My friends always ask me what lipstick I wear. Bad news, though, you can longer get it in stores. AMAZON is the only place it's available. If/when this product is done-zo, you will hear wailing and gnashing of teeth. (I may or may not have 10 tubes stashed away, though)",5.0
"There is no substitute.  Do I want to use Covergirl?  Not really!  I’d rather pay more and have decent packaging.  The top comes off easily, it’s easily broken and pretty ghetto/trailer looking.  A little embarrassing pulling it out of my Valentino handbag, but I can’t give it up.  The color is perfect.  It’s a “cool” color as opposed to warm, but not too pink.  It’s light.  Can easily be too light for some people.  I love it as a top coat for a POP of FROST, not gloss.",5.0
Beautiful shimmery peach - not frosted but it kind of glows - does that make sense? I have ash blonde hair and fair coloring and it really looks good. Just the right amount of color.,5.0
"This review is for #420, ""iced mauve,"" since multiple colors are covered by this listing.This lipstick goes on smoothly and stays on for about half a day for me (so it's definitely competitive with other products in that regard).  It's average when it comes to the appearance of my lips: it doesn't hide flaws, completely, but it doesn't emphasize them, either. If your lips are in decent shape, this should be fine.  It's fairly moisturizing the whole time it's on.The color is subtle.  It shows up and it's darker than the natural color of my lips, but it's not overly dramatic.  It would definitely be suitable for work in an office or professional setting.  I haven't had a problem with feathering when wearing this without a lip liner, either.Here are the ingredients since I don't see them on the product page; please note that not all colors contain all the dyes listed:Castor Seed Oil, Isopropyl Isostearate, Ethylhexyl Hydroxystearate, Acetylated Lanolin, Ozokerite, Candelilla Wax, Paraffin, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetyl Lactate, Carnauba Wax, Retinyl Palmitate Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Propylparaben, Mica, May Contain (+/-):, Red 21 Lake, Red 33 Lake, Yellow 6 Lake, Lauroyl Lysine, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, Orange 5, Red 27, Blue 1 Lake, Red 21, red 27 lake, Red 6 Lake, Red 7 Lake, Yellow 5 Lake, Carmine, Bismuth Oxychloride, Green 5",4.0
"This lipstick in the shade ""It's Your Mauve"" was a soft pink that was about the same color as my natural lips. It doesn't feel the smoothest, but it's not gritty or anything. It has a classic lipstick smell, so no fragrance. Overall, it is a nice product, and I would recommend it, but I personally don't reach for it very often.",4.0
"I was so relieved to find it on Amazon. I have used this color for years and want to continue to...only it isn't easy to find in stores, at least I didn't find it so. It arrived with 2 lipsticks of my color - one for home and one for my pursue. I'm all set!

"First of all, I was so excited to find this discontinued Rose Quartz Cover Girl Lipsticks on Amazon. I bought several other item with it so I was able to purchase this lipstick for under 5 dollars. What a deal because Cover Girl sells as high as 8 dollars for lipsticks in regular stores!PROS:1 Frosty color, looks shiny on my lips. I prefer frosts over cream style lipstick.2 Light pink color...a baby pink really. I have light skin and rosy skin so this enhances my face.3 Color goes with most of my outfits.4 Looks natural on my lips. I am not a heavy makeup type, so this lipstick looks natural.5 When I want a darker ponk, I add a wine color lipstick first and then add this lipstick on top. The result is perfect...a medium pink!If you like a baby pink lipstick, you will probably like this alot. But just know this color is very light. But for 8 years I have been wearing this lipstick. It is my favorite color.Thanks Amazon for carrying this, I bought three of these!",5.0
Was the color I wanted!!!  Matches what I had been buying for years from Clinique (Honey Gloss/discontinued) for a fraction of the cost!!!I am truly pleased with this line and with this purchase!  Way to go CG!!!  I thought I'd never find a lipstick with no nasty smell for such a deal!I love the color and texture too!  BONUS!!!,5.0
I've been using this product for several years and still love it.  It goes well with almost any color outfit I'm wearing. And the best thing is that instead of having to buy a different product to apply color to my cheeks - I just dab a little dot on each cheek with the lipstick tube and gently spread it to the degree of pink I need on my cheeks and it instantly matches my lipstick!,5.0
I always believe you can't go wrong with Cover Girl.  I've used their products for years.  This lipstick is a beautiful pink color.  Not overpowering and just right.  It lasts long and glides on so smoothly and is a creamy lipstick.,5.0

"I usually don't write reviews on makeup but I had to on this lipstick. I recently bought the continuous color lipstick in a mauve shade and was impressed with how long it lasted. I have pale skin and mauves and pinks are all I can get away with. I've spent literally hundreds of dollars trying to find a red I can wear that isn't too bright and doesn't look clownish and I finally found it! Shade 425 vintage wine. Not a true red, but flattering and natural looking, almost the exact shade of my lips but a bit darker. I've been searching for this my whole life! The staying power is impressive, I work a physical job where I'm sweating a lot and drinking gallons of water and halfway through my shift I still have a hint of color, a quick swipe and I'm back to beautiful lips. I love how moisturizing it is, and the price is unbeatable! For those who can't pull off wearing red, try this.",5.0

"I've been using this color for years. It is a nice frosted lipstick, light to medium pink that works well with any color attire. The number is 415, but don't make the mistake in buying Cover Girl's new #415 called ""delight blush"" because it is not frosted and is a harsh bright pink.",5.0

"I bought this in Iced Mauve and Bronzed Peach. The lipstick is great. Nice, bold color. I only needed to apply once and the color lasted even through food and drink within reason. My only complaint is that the color tends to bleed. It's not as noticeable with the lighter colors, but with a dark red it can look sloppy.",4.0
425 is a pinkish wine color. It's a pretty color but not great with my complexion. If I blot it after application it works better; tends to lessen the pink tint. Longer lasting than any other brand lipstick I've ever tried.,4.0
"I love the color and the moisture it has so my lips don't look dry.  I do have to apply it several times a day, but it is worth it.",5.0
"I absolutely love this lipstick and this shade! In fact, I have been using it continuously for several years now and have had situations when I could not find it in the stores. The shade is very subtle and shimmery, almost translucent, with no trace of pink at all; this works perfectly for my complexion and coloring. I love how the lipstick glides and stays on my lips. I was even happier when I found out that amazon.com carries subscriptions on this shade. So now it will get delivered to my door - no need to waste my time hunting for it at the retail stores.",5.0
"Everything is great about this lipstick and it really keeps your lips colored and stays on a long time.However, CoverGirl needs to work on their colors. The Classic Red is not a classic red at all. It's gottoo much blue color and is more of a berry color rather than red. It needs more warm colors in it to bea true red. I've tried some other colors and they just aren't quite right. If they fine tune their colors, Iwould agree that it's the best and most cost effective lipstick on the market.",3.0
"Great color, stays on well and am constantly receiving compliments.  Am ditching the drawer full of other lip colors.",5.0
I purchased this item for my Mom.  She uses it constantly-loves the color and it glides on easi ly.,5.0
"I love these strips! Throw some water on the areas you need cleaned, put the strip on, clean the house a little and then pull off and bam, you're done! What's great is how much they actually do work!",5.0
"Like everyone else, I'm having to cut-back on spending. Therefore, instead of buying my fav. Estee Lauder products, I went to the store with coupons in hand and purchased 4 tubes of CoverGirl Continuous Color: 2-Sugar Almond, 1-Rose Quartz and 1-Bronzed Peach. I am beyond shocked - these are great!!!  They go on smoothly, don't dry out my lips and the color actually stays on for hours.  I am very impressed with it, and even more impressed when I receive Sunday-paper coupons and save money on CoverGirl products.  This is my new favorite lipstick and naturally, as is my luck, it must have been discontinued in stores since most all other reviewers say that it did.  I must have lucked up and gotten the last of them at the huge smiley-face store. :)Even though I did NOT purchase the lipstick from Amazon, I felt like I needed to give it a good review.  Afterall, I go to Amazon for reviews on products all of the time; I'm sure that other people do too.",5.0
This lipstick is creamy and feels good on the lips.  The color seems to darken when applied.,4.0
"Probably the best lipstick I've ever used...it's super moisturizing and gives my lips such a gorgeous shine. Usually I don't use lipstick because most of them make my lips feel dry and I'm not much of a matte shade girl, but this is perfect for me because I like my makeup to be more dewy and glossy. I own this in rose quartz and sugar almond. I will continue to use this product as long as I can find the colors I like.",5.0
"The color is nice enough, but holy crap, this stuff wouldn't stay with you even if you bribed it. A half an hour from applying, I take a drink from a white paper cup and BAM, half of it is gone in one sip. Absolutely ridiculous. Why even bother putting it on when it's going to come off that easily?",2.0
"I have used this lipstick for years. But a few years ago it was taken out of the stores or discontinued for some reason so I had to try other shades etc. which did not look that great on me. I was so happy to later find this on Amazon one day. I always order extra tubes so I don't run out. When I put this lipstick on, my face just seems to light up. It is easy to apply and stays on for a reasonable amount of time.",5.0
"This is all I have used for a decade now. I like the way it looks. I like the way it feels. I use it like chapstick. And now I have to hunt it down because it has been discontinued. Keep selling it, Amazon!",5.0

I have worn the bronzed peach for many years and I just couldn't find it anywhere else except Amazon !  Thank you -,5.0
"The color is a little different then how i expected it to look however I still love it! it has slightly glitter look but still a beautiful color! Id recommend, especially for the price, you can't go wrong with it.",4.0
Love the color and look it gives my lips however it does have to be applied frequently.,4.0
"The only good thing I can say about this lipstick is that the color is very pretty.  It's not as long-lasting as other lipsticks of a similar ilk, but what is worse is that, after a couple of weeks of wear, it has made my lips extremely sore, extremely dry and they are now peeling.  And nothing is helping to soothe them.  It's a mess.  I do find I'm extremely sensitive to several lipsticks - ones containing gloss or moisturizer, for example - but this is the first long-lasting lippy I've had a problem with.  There's definitely some ingredient(s) to which I'm allergic.  If you don't have sensitive lips then you may really like this product, but it's a big fail for me.",1.0
This lipstick is smoothly applied at a good texture on the lips. The color compliments my skin as well.,5.0
"I asked for this shade because of the recommendation from the CG website. It's a nice color and all, but it's not the right one for me. It's subtle and sweet.",4.0
"The lipstick goes on fine and I have no complaints with the formula as far as cheaper lipsticks go, but I found this particular color to be too ""frosted"" and 80's-ish. I was expecting more of a nude pink.",3.0
Perfect - love this lipstick and couldn't find it anywhere locally.  Love Amazon!!,5.0

Pretty color for a great price.  Shipping was lightening fast!,5.0
I love this lipstick. I used this product for several years but it has apparently been discontinued from store shelves so I was so happy to be able to get it on line.  Love the color and the feel of it. Also received two tubes in the package which was a bonus.  Please keep it available.,5.0
Best lipstick.,5.0
"I always buy Cover Girl, so I was not disappointed in this purchase.  I wasn't sure about the color, but thought it would probably work out, especially since the price was right!  The color was just as pictured, so I'm very happy with this purchase.",5.0
Best price I have found on Cover Girl lipstick. This style is getting hard to find. I don't know if it is being discontinued or not. Right now Amazon has it.,5.0

"I have used this product for many years...so long, in fact, that it is not longer available in any local retail outlet.  Ergo, Amazon to the rescue!",5.0
I was very disappointed. Do yourself a favor and pay 1/2 dollars more for a decent store brand lipstick. You'll just end up trashing this one,1.0
