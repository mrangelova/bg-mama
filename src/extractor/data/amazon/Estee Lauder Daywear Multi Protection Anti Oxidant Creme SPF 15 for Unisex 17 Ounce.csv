"I want to let everyone know that this is not the same cream that is sold currently in stores. I'm not sure where this is coming from, but the packaging is not the same and the wonderful cucumber smell is not apparent. This cream is either old, discontinued or from out of the country, it's not terrible, but it is not the same cream. (See picture for comparison).",2.0
Exactly the same Daywear that they sell at the department stores. This moisturizer is the best I've tried - including over the counter ones - and it smells nice - like cucumbers - which provide a refreshing smell & feeling,5.0
I have used this moisturizer from 20 years. It is the best moisurizer and I worked at Macys and tried them all,5.0
"This is the best moisturizer that I have ever used.  It makes your skin feel really soft and makeup goes on smoothly.  It is pricey, but it's the best and if you use it daily you will be pleased with the results.  Even though I use it daily, one jar lasts me a couple of months or more.",5.0
"I thought this would be a good day moisturizer, but it isn't very moisturizing.  After I put it on, my skin still feels tight and flakes off.  Not satisfied with the amount of money I paid for this cream.",2.0
"I love this face cream.  I actually had a smaller sample version of it that was free with a purchase.  I used it ALL up and desperately needed MORE!  I love the fragrance and it makes my skin feel so silky smooth!  It's just a tad bit pricey (found it less expensive on Amazon), but it's worth it!",5.0
Love this product and was pleasantly surprised to find it here.,5.0
"This is an excellent product that I have purchased many times in the store.  I is not heavy, absorbs nicely, and I have not found anything better for my senior, thin, dry skin; however, I think it would be great on any skin.  My daughter loves it too.  My only concern is whether or not the jar is getting smaller.",4.0
Smells like cucumbers with great texture!,5.0
I don't know if I like it or not. It works okay on my skin (I got sensitive skin) but the SPF doesn't really protect my skin from the sun. It's too expensive if compared with Olay. I used Olay and it worked wonderfully.,3.0
"This is a wonderful product!  I used it for years, and I've had great results with it.  Once my mother move in with us, I bought it for her.  She had a really dry spot her forehead; but using this product has softened it.  I really like it because it has the SPF protection, too.  I recommend it to everyone and purchase it as gifts.  The recipients seem to love it and have begun to buy it for themselves.",5.0
This is a product that I love and have used for years.  I am thrilled that I can purchase it on line and at a better price that it costs at Macy's.,5.0

"We had a horrible experience with this Estee Lauder product. This product came with high recommendations and we were surprised when we started seeing rashes and scales on my wife's forehead and cheeks skin after 3-4 days of application. The rashes left a black patch and at places raw skin.We contacted Estee Lauder as we did not want to return a good product - which responded after 3 weeks - ""Products sold to our authorized accounts are genuine Estée Lauder. Amazon.com is not one of our accounts and we have no control over the merchandise that they sell. Further, we have no way of knowing how they obtained our products.""So I am stuck with a product which caused severe allergies and Estee Lauder telling me they cannot verify if this is a genuine product.",1.0
Great product.  Love the texture and SPF coverage.I use with other products from Yonka and Clinique and it's just the right moisturizer coverage for my normal to dry skin.Buy it!,5.0
"I can't live without this product. I use it every morning and sometimes 1/2 way thru the day. The SPF is a must everyday to keep your skin looking young, but this product also takes away my dark circles as makes my akin look radiant.",5.0

"I've been using this product for years.  I've tried other products over the years, especially if I'm trying to economize, but I always come back to my Estee Lauder products.  They seem to work for me no matter my age.  I also think they work best if you use them together with other Estee  products.  I've done both, but I get the best results when I use daywear with Estee foundation.",5.0
"I have used this product for the past year, and it is fabulous.  Moisturizes without making your skin feel greasy.  It is light and very effective, plus has 15 spf.  Foundation blends beautifully underneath this product, and it is does not clog pores or cause breakouts, like some of the brands on the market.  I have tried so many, I am a little bit of a product junky, and this is by far the best.  The Creme lasts for about 4 to 5 months!!  A little goes a long way, so it is a great investment!!",5.0
"I have used this product for years.  I started using it after trying several other moisturizes by different beauty companies.  It moisturizes your face without a greasy or heavy feeling.  I also appreciate the mild scent and the sunscreen protection it provides.  Of course, I will apply additional sunscreen if I'm going to be at a beach or a outdoor event with no protection from the sun.",5.0
I bought this for my mom and she loved it!!! Just what she had asked for.  It was also with a two-day shipping and it arrived on time. So I'm happy with the purchase.,5.0

Bought this for my teen daughter who was having an extreme amount of outbreaks. She has oily skin and other moisturizers we tried made it worse. I had a sample from a purchase I made at Dillards that she tried and it cleared up her skin and no more outbreaks! She said her skin feels so soft and hydrated but not oily.,5.0
"Makes my oily skin feel oily. So, it is not what I need. Yes, it smells good,good consistent, pleasant to apply but I feel like I used a night cream. Shiseido is much better.",3.0
"This is not the same product that you buy in a department store. This looks the same but is not. It reminds me more of sunscreen in which it goes on white and you have to keep rubbing it in. Also, the smell is completely different. It doesn't have that melon scent. It's more of s bland smell. It stinks!",1.0
"Fantastic product.  I am 79 years young and I have been using this DayWear since, I can't remember when.  Have always been a big fan of Estee Lauder products.  Can't afford most of them now but I make sure I get this one.  Keeps my skin supple and soft, don't get me wrong, I still have wrinkles, but they are soft wrinkles.I'm too cool to be called great-grandmother, so my kids got me a t-shirt that says ""so I'm called GiGi"".attached photo of me, my oldest daughter and my great-grandaughter",5.0
"It's not the same cream you can buy from a store. The feel and smell are far worse than the original. Don't buy it, it's fake.",1.0
"I was given the .5 oz/15 ml sample size by my grandmother and it has changed my life.My skin is SO ridiculously sensitive and this doesn't bother me at all, in fact it has made my skin better!I now no longer use a foundation because it has cleared up my skin and given it a brighter more even tone. I don't even need make up!If i do wear make up, I just apply this, Ulta's fabulous face foundation primer, a bronzer and an illuminizer.It smells so lovely! Such a light and inviting scent.Normally i use unscented products (cetaphil, cerave, simple) because i'm so sensitive but this works wonderfully, and it's reduced my redness in a way that the other products couldn't. I feel amazing with this stuff on, i can definitely tell a difference just one sample size later (i'm almost out). I will be ordering this again and again. I am in love with this product.Thank you Estee Lauder and thank you grandma!",5.0
"I've been using this product for 7+ years. I took a hiatus a few years ago and started using cheap drugstore brands. Big mistake! There was a visible decline in my skin's clarity and elasticity. I'll never turn away from you again Day Wear! You keep my skin looking flawless! I constantly get compliments on my skin, and its all thanks to you.",5.0
"Amazing. I actually first tried this because it came in a small Estée Lauder gift set I had boughten. The smell is perfect and refreshing, and it leaves your skin luminous and glowy, yet not oily or too shiny looking. Was using Chanel hydramax moisturizer before and I just switched to this one. 10x better and a lot cheaper. I would deff recommend for any skin type.",5.0
"I've used this product for almost 3-3.5 years. I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin. I tried to replace product several times for one reason..I don't put make up when i go out I only use cream with SPF, this one provides what I need but after sometime outside specially when it is hot the cream on my forehead ""melts""? down to get to my eyes and I get very horrible time trying to wipe the cream around my eyes. It is still my favorite as it is really enhanced my skin little bit and felt my skin resist sun damage (I try to minimize time under sun). I recommend this product if you find a good way to prevent or reduce cream getting to eyes.",5.0
"This is my favorite moisturizer,  love the product.",5.0
"I'm 24 and my skin is very sensitive - it's getting red even with a strong sunscreen on. This cream is absolutely unbelievable, makes my skin feels so good!!! I love the smell and the texture and it protects my skin! It doesn't make my skin oily or dry, - it calms and softens. Also a good base for a make up!",5.0
"This lotion is very lightweight and smells of cucumber fragrance.  SPF 15 is not enough sun protection, and I use it as a base layer underneath BB cream w/ sunscreen.  It's pricey but the quality of the product is fabulous.  The thinness of the lotion and the refreshing scent is perfect.  I wish it had a bit more SPF, but overall a fantastic product.",5.0
