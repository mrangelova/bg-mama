"This goes on nicely, and it absorbs well while leaving my skin feeling smooth, not greasy..a little goes a long way too.I felt like this brightened my complexion and helped lighten my post acne marks and dark spots, it also didn't break me out which is a huge plus.I'm 34 so while I have a small amount of wrinkles I cant say for sure this helped with them. I apply this nightly after the serum.",4.0

As usual it's ESTEE LAUDER what else do I need to say. The ESTEE LAUDER products are the best for all of my skin care needs. I purchase whatever I can though Amazon. Being a Prime Member is a great advantage to shopping for all of my skin care needs through Amazon.,5.0
