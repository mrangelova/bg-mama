"I purchased this for my Wife at Christmas and she was on her last jar so she went to a local store (starts with M end in ys) and bought another jar. Let me warn you the item sold is not what you would get from a reputable retailer. A side by side comparison showed that the product sold here is at best watered down. She noticed marked improvement over the past few days and has been using a fraction of what she was using with this forgery. Do yourself a favor and spend a few extras $ on the real thing, you are just wasting your money here. Caveat emptor, next time I will be more careful.",1.0

"I love this Estee Lauder product but the version from Amazon is a fraud. It is not the same product and a complete waste of money. The bottle is even a cheap version. The amazon product is just like a weak lotion - it does not smell the same, it does not feel the same, and does not work the same. I was ripped off. Go to the Estee Lauder web site to get the real products and free shipping. BUYER BE AWARE!",1.0
I beleive the produc is fake. I have been using Estee Lauder Perfectionist for the past 15 years. I still have my previous bottle so I have compared the two products. The one I just purchased smells like body milk while the one I had at home have the usual characteristics nice smell of Perfectionist. I dont know how it is posible since the bottle seems normal.. but the product inside is definitely not perfectionist.,1.0
Can't wait to try it ;),5.0
"The bottle arrived with the spring broken, which is very frustrating as I have to open it in order to use the serum and thus I am using a bigger amount than by using the normal way of pressing it. I am using this product for many years.",1.0
This is NOT  the same product I bought from Estee Lauder. It does NOT work at all! It is almost like just water.,1.0
"The genuine bottle came in a genuine box, but in the bottle was a substance that was ANYTHING BUT Estee Lauder Perfectionist [CP+R] product.  I regret not having read these reviews prior finalizing my order.",1.0
"I have used this product for over 14 years. I purchased it, for the first time, from Amazon and received it Monday. The serum in this bottle is NOT the perfectionist you get at an Estee Lauder counter. It feels sticky and is a thick white solution, It smells like Oil of Olay.  I am very disappointed and will NOT ever buy anything else from AMAZON!  BEWARE!!!!",1.0
"I purchased this at a local department store and have been using this for 3 months. The first two months I used twice a day as the instructions state. I stopped using it twice daily because there was no noticeable long term differencel. However, it does appear to smooth wrinkles temporarily when used before applying makeup. I use this in conjunction with a Clarins product, Instant Smooth, which literally fills in the wrinkles.I gave three stars because it does smooth the wrinkles long enough for daily use, but I didn't see any long term wrinkle improvement.",3.0
This was filled up with something else - would not buy this ever again,1.0

"Estee Lauder provided a refund for this product and another one I bought from their website. This product made my wrinkles worse. Don't know if it takes time to see results, but very embarrassing to use product since it just wasn't right for my skin. Unfortunately I bought this on amazon and didn't get item refunded.",1.0

"My wife thinks this stuff is the greatest thing since popcorn!  Yes, she rants and raves about it, so it must be good.  She has been using this for a long time and swears by it, even though I think it is pricey.  As they say, a woman's vanity has few boundaries, but I'm a man, so what do I know?",5.0
I have used this product for several yrs. and will not use anything else. It makes my skin so soft and since i have dry skin it also has lots of moisturizer in it. I would highly recommend it.,5.0
It's always good to my skin. This is the second one.,5.0
"Definitely worth it! I've tried so many different products ranging from Olay all the way to La Prarie. None of them have given me the kind of results as this serum. I'm in my 20s and just started seeing the first signs of smile lines. After a couple of months of using this product, my skin has a beautiful glow and the smile lines have completely gone away. Couldn't be any happier with this product.",5.0
