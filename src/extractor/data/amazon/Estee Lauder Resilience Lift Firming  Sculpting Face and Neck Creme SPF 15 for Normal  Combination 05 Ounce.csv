Great product.  I had many comments on how great my skin looks after just a month or so of using.  Not greasy at all and just kind of melts in to your skin leaving it feeling soft and hydrated.  Estee Lauder products are incredible but getting them for a better price on here makes buying them a little better- they can get pricey at the mall.,5.0

"I don't think this is true, but it's a great product. I've been using it for many years. The texture, how it feels on my face, and the smell are delightful.  It's not shiny. I put it on soon after I shower and put makeup on half an hour or so later. I want it to soak in. It's so moist that I don't have to point any more on when I apply the makeup.

My mother in law bought me the red leather case full of Estee Lauder for Christmas. The first time I used this product I was hooked. I have used many expensive creams and have never found one that I like more than this one. I ran out before I ordered, so I used my old face cream. I truly could not wait til my shipment arrived!",5.0
I LOVE this cream! Noticeable difference in just a couple of weeks of use. Firms and smoothes all day and perfect for under makeup.,5.0
"I can switch back and forth from the time zone to the resilience lift and I am glad they both have the spf in the product instead of having to put it on seperately.I like this cream too and I was thinking of trying the night and eye creams, but for now I am liking the time zone.  I will do the switch in the winter months.",5.0

"I have been using different products of EL for 25 years. This is my current day cream.  I am 60 and, as a blonde, I did do probably a bit too much sun bathing in my time.  However, after all the different face creams I tried, this is the company that served my skin the best.  Visible difference was the one I used to use, and now I use this.  There are several other in the ultra expensive category I haven't tried, but I am very happy with this product.  Cream doesn't ""firm"" your skin.  Some of the reviews here are ludicrous.  What a moisturizer should do is not add to larger pores, keep your skin moisturized and flexible and reduce the advance of wrinkles, as they inevitably take their place on an older woman's face. Find a cream that works, and this one works for me very well, but remember to drink at least8 glasses of water a day.  Water is the skin's best friend.",5.0

"This product is okay, but I have extra dry skin and was hoping for more moisture than it gave me.  I just re-apply during the day, but, that, of course, uses more of the product so it will not last as long.",3.0
"I have used ton of neck firming creams and never could really tell a difference until I tried this one.  Not only can you see the difference, but you can feel a difference!  The under the chin skin that you can pull down and see, giving you the double chin look, will firm right up.  I started noticing a difference in about 2 days and it just keeps getting better.  But do beware that this is not a permanent fix.  If you quit using your skin will eventually start to sag again.  But this is the quickest and most noticeable difference front a moisturizer I have seen and I have tried almost all of them at our local retail stores.  You won't be sorry if you try it, but you might become addicted...lol.",5.0

"I have always used Clinique for men or Estee Lauder on my face and neck because of getting older I need a little help with wrinkles. However, this does not really get rid of the wrinkles but it does cover blemishes in the skin. So, it's more like a make-up than wrinkle firmer and I have never worn make-up in my life. Being male I am very concerned about wrinkles but have never worn make-up to cover wrinkles. I would recommend this to anyone male or female if he/she wants to cover blemishes on the skin.",3.0

Was looking for something to help with those little lines in the upper lip. This comes close...along with the serum from Estee Lauder too. Very good product. I also use the green cream for those areas that don't need to be tightened but do need to be moistened. This cream doesn't seem to be for moisturizing...mainly for firming.,5.0
"It is a sample with the statement ""not for individual resale"" on it as described by another reviewer, but I was expecting that and was willing to pay the price I paid for it.

I don't know what happened to this product but I usually love Estee Lauder products but this one I am not sure i would assure anyone that it has been handled properly or that it is genuine. I use many different Estee Lauder products but this one smelled awful after putting it on. My hands and face smelled like horrible body odor after applying this product to my neck and face. I sent it back! Nothing else i have ever used has had such an odor to it. You can barely smell it until you put in on your skin. If you have purchased this put it on your hand first and test the smell before you put it on your face. I figured it out the first time I used it thank goodness but wish i had tested it on my hand first!,1.0

"I actually received this in a gift package from Macy's after purchasing an Estee Lauder foundation. I really love the feel of it on my skin, even the shine, the SPF factor is awesome, and it's incredibly moisturizing for those of us with dry skin. Does it lift and firm. Hmmm, it's too soon for me to tell and, honestly, I don't see that. But I'm 68 and have much to lift! LOL  I would definitely recommend this cream. Would I purchase it? Probably not because of the price, however, one can always seek out specials and look for it in a gift package after purchasing other products. The sample is quite ample... .5 oz.",5.0

Great peace of mind because of this and I hope I can continually buy this.  The product was excellent.",5.0
I've always loved Estee Lauder products and was thrilled to see I could buy them at a discount on Amazon.The cream has a thick density to it when you put it on you can almost feel your skin firming up.

I put it on twice a day. I dab a little under my eyes after washing my face at night and I dab a little on in the morning before applying my makeup. It does not irritate my eyes and the smell is really non existant. There is a light smell but nothing harsh. I highly recommend.",5.0

"Terrible! It's too scented, heavy, oily and doesn't absorb.When I put it on my neck, I actually get rolled up dirt and residue from the product. There's so much, I have to brush it off of my shirt.
