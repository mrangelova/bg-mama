Great product. Creamy. Not only cleans my face but leaves it smooth. It also has a very pleasant smell.,5.0
"I'm not sure why Estee Lauder has replaced this product with another cleanser, but this is the cleanser I have been using for years, so I ordered it in bulk.  I guess when it runs out, I'll have to change my cleanser, but in the meantime, I'm happy.",5.0
"I was very happy to find this product, since Estee Lauder has discontinued (changed the product). This is a wonderful product to help you remove your make up at night. It is  soapy in consistency, you do not need a lot to make it work. I enjoy the smell not to strong and it smells like clean.",4.0
"Works great for facial cleansing.  I do not wear a lot of makeup, but I do like the feel of really clean skin when I wash my face.  This product removes all traces of any makeup without drying out my skin.  I have been using this product for years and hopefully will be able to continue to purchase.",5.0
"There used to be a version of this ""Splash Away Cleanser"" but it was discontinued last year. I liked the old one.  This new one smells more perfumey.  It smells more like pink bottle cleanser and i do not like.  i will find a new brand when my old one it out.",2.0
I wish Estee Lauder would start selling this specific product again!  I love it so much and the new formula they sell is just not the same.,5.0
Absolutely the best facial wash product! I've used it for years with amazing results.,5.0
You only have to use a teeny tiny amount of this to wash your whole face and neck! Love it! It seems expensive except when you consider how long a tube lasts. It can be slightly drying if you are prone to dry skin.,5.0
My favorite cleanser,5.0
"This is my favorite cleanser.  A tube of this size lasted about 4-5 months, while washing my face twice a day.  It has a very light and pleasant scent.  You use very little for each application and it really foams.  It doesn't dry out your skin and leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean, refreshed, and light feeling.  There are no heavy oils or lotions added that can leave your skin feeling heavy and the pores clogged.  Great stuff!",5.0
I've used this for a  few years and I love the way it leaves my face soft and clean.  I have aging skin and have been through cancer treatments on my face.  This has been so gentle yet so cleansing - wouldn't be without it.,5.0
"I don't use this makeup remover on my face because of the heavy perfume, but it is *fantastic* as a brush and sponge cleaner!  It even removed stains from long-wearing foundations.  Too bad Estee Lauder discontinued it.  Figures.",4.0

Delivered as promised and the product matched its description.,5.0
I love this product!!! It leaves my skin refreshed and clean!! I've tried many other cleansers and no product has cleaned my face and removed my makeup as well as the Clean Splash Away by Estée Lauder!,5.0

I love this stuff you only need a dab its so creamy makes your face feel so soft and clean I wouldnt use anything eles,5.0

This is the best cleanser out there. You can feel it when you cleanse your face. When you put makeup on the most important step is the cleansing part.,5.0
My favorite.,5.0
Alittle goes a long way. Aa small dab washes your whole face and takes all your make off.  Great poduct!,5.0
"Used to be named Splash Away. Amazing product opens pores and deep cleans, pleasantly foaming to loosen and rinse away sebum and old skin ready to slough. If you like being clean but with balanced Ph this is for you.",5.0
excelente,5.0
"Since  started using this product, I have not strayed nor needed to. It works perfectly for me. Even though it's a bit more pricey than most facial wash products, you use just a little dub . So it takes me more than 3 months to get through one. So it ends up being well worth it since it's my perfect product !!",5.0
"I first rec'd this a part of a GWP at Lord and Taylor. You only need a tiny bit-it turns into a luxurious foam (and I have hard water--you'd only need a NANOliter if you lived in a soft-water environment!) that leaves your face feeling clean.  Rinses away nicely, too.Seller was very prompt in shipping.  Totally good experience! Thanks.",5.0
"I really like this product and was impressed with the Estee Lauder Perfectly Clean splash away foaming cleanser 4.2oz/125mlservice that I recieved when I ordered this item! The product came way before I expected it and was packaged very well, while the price was very reasonable.",5.0
"Unfortunately Estee Lauder has discontinued this particular formula and I'm not happy about it as I love this stuff. It completely removes my makeup, lasts a long time as you only need a little bit and it doesn't cause me to breakout. I have sensitive oily skin.",5.0
After looking for better cleanser for years and my friend recommended me this one. I have to say it's the best. Definitely worth the price.,5.0
My ex girlfriend works for Estee Lauder and she introduced me to  Perfectly Clean Splash.It works great! Even for guys.,5.0
"Have been using this for years. They changed the scent some time back, but I still love it, and how it cleans my face so well. It is very gentle without drying my skin out. Always feel very refreshed after using it.",5.0
"Initially when I started using this product I didn't like it. I was convinced it was giving my face this plastic look about it. But me being the cheapo I can sometimes be, I kept using it bc I paid for it. Eventually the plastic look went away so I'm not sure if it was from this product or another product I was using in conjunction with it. Either way I love this face wash now and use it morning and night. It makes my face feel like how my mouth feels after I've just eaten a peppermint. Oh so fresh!",5.0
"I'm reviewing this for the product but have not purchased from Amazon. I get this at the department store. I'm a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn't sensitive or acne prone.This is a top five facial cleansers that I'll usually use in the summertime. It cleanses my skin so, SO well but doesn't leave it feeling super tight/dry. With this as part of my routine, I generally stay matte all day. Note: it's very humid during the summer in MN. My other favorites:-Purpose Gentle (in winter)-Shiseido Men Deep Cleansing Scrub (twice/week all year)-Shiseido/Shu Uemura/DHC oil cleanser (winter and pre-shave)-DHC Washing Powder/Dermalogica Microfoliant (all year)(Ok, so that's obviously 8 cleansers but I've split into categories somewhat.)",5.0
"I received this as a free gift & being a regular Cetaphil user that I love with the exception of it not being great at removing non-waterproof mascara, I was open to trying something new.  This product felt greasy like cold cream. I'm ok w that since has great moisturizing/cleansing properties but I wasn't prepared for the extreme sting I felt in my eyes while using this product the 2 times I tried it. So much so that 30 minutes after using it tonight my eyes are still recovering. My only other recent experience with Estee Lauder is their lipstick & lipgloss - both of which had a nasty taste. This company needs to up their testing - and I am not talking about animal testing!",2.0
"I got this product as a gift with purchase and I really like it! It's a thick cleanser (which I like) so you don't need a whole lot per use. It washes away cleanly too. This is actually for normal to combination skin. My preference is a cleanser for oily skin but it still worked pretty well.As usual, this Estee Lauder product is a little pricey.  Also, as usual, the Estee Lauder product is a quality product. I gave it five stars because I believe the two balance each other out. If the price is affordable for you, then it's worth buying because you'll get what you pay for.",5.0
"This foaming cleanser is pricey, but I don't have to use very much of it at all to remove makeup, oil etc.  It doesn't leave my skin dried out and it truly is ""splash-away"": not too much water needed to remove the soap.",4.0
"I got this as part of a gift set for Christmas!  I was like, ""Geez, what a tiny bottle!  Rip off!"" when I saw it- but you only need the tiniest bit and it works up into a delicious lather.  It smells great- not overpowering, just a gentle scent.  Leaves my skin feeling clean and moist all at once.",5.0
"This cleanser removes makeup, sunscreen, and daily residue without drying my skin.  The texture is creamy and the smell is gently fragrant.  Along with the toner it leaves my skin bright and refreshed.  A gentle, effective cleanser.",5.0
"I don't normally endorse products, but this is my exception simply because it is so good.  I got a sample of this product, tried it and just LOVE it.  Just a tiny bit foams into enough for my whole face, rinses away beautifully, and my face is so smooth, soft and fresh feeling.  I've used Mary Kay cleansers for 20+ years and never tried anything else, feeling satisfied, but Estee Lauder's giving of samples paid off for them on this one with me. I love this product!",5.0
This stuff is a miracle product and very inexpensive.  My face is super smooth from using this every night to clean my face.  You MUST get this product today!!!,5.0
This cleanser has really helped to eliminate blotches.  It's the best cleanser I have ever used.  Gentle and effective.,5.0
Estee Lauder Perfectly clean is an excellent product.  In the department stores it is $18.00 plus tax.  Amazon's price of $25.00 is way too much.,1.0
Amazon is not always the best deal. Amazon charges double on all estee lauder products be careful what you buy...,1.0
