"This scent reminds me of both Opium and Estee Lauder Youth Dew. Bold, spicy, warm, & sweet. A light touch is best. This is quite potent, so more than one spray will probably overpower those near you. More suitable for cooler months.",4.0

"A pet peeve of mine is receiving goods I've paid good money for, only to find out that they are past the date of usefulness.  I have always loved Cinnabar and looked forward to using it again.  The oils are so stale that the only thing I can use it for is to sweeten the inside of a trash bag.  Cinnabar itself is lovely.  Just watch where you buy it.",1.0
"The bottle has leaked everywhere and wasted a ton of the contents, this perfume is a luxury that I buy only once a year and now almost half of the bottle has leaked and wasted.",1.0
I no longer smell like cat urine...just a few sprays and I smell so fresh and clean.  I find that I can now 3-5 days without a bath or shower if I wear this.  My only complaint is that it smells so fantastic that both men and women are attracted to me- everyone is intoxicated with its mind altering scent.  I love it!  It has changed my entire life...I now have the desire to lose those couple extra hundred pounds that have been bothering me.,5.0
"I don't care for this scent. I like soft florals. To me this smells like the  old BlackFlag insect spay my dad use to use when I was growing up...Some of you may like this, to each his own. But I don't .Est√©e Lauder , please make some soft florals. I do love your Youth Dew! Since my mom introduced me to it when I was a teen.. but this Cinnabar is bad. Sorry üòê",1.0
"I don't believe this is the same formula as the original. I still have some left in my old, original bottle and put a bit from each on opposite wrists. They don't smell the same to me. My old bottle smells earthier, muskier. Won't be ordering this again which is a shame. I have worn this fragrance fall and winter since my grandma died 25 years ago, reminds me of her.",1.0
"I used to use Opium and had used it since the first year it appeared on the market.  The fragrance was wonderful and it had real ""staying power.""  But the formula was obviously changed a few years ago and it was NOT a change for the better.  I've been looking for a fragrance in the same exotic mode and I've finally found it.  CINNABAR!!!  it's wonderful -- much better even than the old Opium.  So all your former Opium lovers -- try Cinnabar.  You'll love it.",5.0
I love Cinnabar and have worn it for 30 years. I have noticed that the bottle is a different design and the scent is not as strong as it has been previously.  It seems to me that they changed the formulation and possibly diluting it. I also noticed that it doesn't last as long and I have to reapply it more often.  It's a shame because it was my favorite perfume that I've been wearing for 30 years.,3.0
"This is not the same formulation as the original, a pale echo of its former self. So disappointed, why did they change a good thing? For all of those who wrote reviews touting its strength and spicy scent, don't be surprised when you order a new bottle (no longer in a red box with the iconic octagonal red top) and it doesn't smell the same. I've worn it since it first came out (yes, that dates me), and I managed to find three of the old bottles to keep in the fridge to take out and use once in a blue moon. So long, old friend. RIP. Shame on Est√©e Lauder.",1.0
"I won the hearts of two husbands under the magic of Cinnabar. Now, in my dotage, I hope for one final conquest - before I die. Soft skin, white teeth, a trim, lithe form - and the fragrance of Asian spice. Will he resist? Stay tuned ....",5.0
"I've worn this fragrance since out came out in 1978, prior to that the Youth Dew.  I'm livid that they have changed a classic fragrance...Estee would be furious...it's literally disgusting...Friends the  "" New"" is AWFUL...",1.0
"My wife was thrilled when I gave her this. Perfume has a strong but very nice scent to it. Price was good and it arrived in the specified time. I was very pleased she was pleased and you guys know how important that is.Some other reviews have mentioned that the scent had changed from what it once was or that it had gone bad. My wife said her bottle was fine and we both agreed that it was fine and smelled great.My guess is that  Estee Lauder may have had a bad batch of this or the bottles that others were complaining about might have been very old from sitting to long somewhere.I can highly recommend this and if someone were to buy it and it was bad, Amazon's customer service is very good about replacing or refunding a defective product.",5.0
This is just not what it was years ago....its missing that rich under tone it used to have.  i wish companies would quit messing with the classic scents!!!,3.0
I have worn the perfume for over 25 years and the bottle I just got has no smell at all. I usually get the bottle with the cinnamon colored top and will never order this type of bottle again.,1.0
"Cinnabar has been my signature scent for 30 years, since I first smelled it on a friend. I felt great putting it on in the morning, I received compliments about it all the time, & it lasted all day.

Love this perfume. Always have. If you like spicy or musky scents and not flowery you should try it. Amazon.com is the most reliable source. It is rarely in stores but for the holiday season.,5.0
I love this perfume.  It was my signature scent in high school and it brings back so many memories when I wear it.  It is a classic scent and I always get complimented on it.  VERY long lasting...a little goes a long way!,5.0
"This has been a sort of ""signature"" scent, since I accidentally discovered it years ago, though I confess to wearing something lighter during the summer.  When my grandkids arrive with hugs, they say things like, ""Mmm!  You smell good,"" or ""you smell like Grammy."" I had never been successful with scents in the past (I avoid the detergent aisles in stores and won't walk into candle stores).  They either made me sneeze, seriously inflamed my sinuses or made me smell like I'd immersed myself in fly-spray (even the ridiculously expensive brands worn by friends).  I've never had a complaint about it having a negative reaction for others, though I get lots of, ""What are you wearing--it smells great."" Maybe that's because I ""spritz"" in the air BEFORE I dress and then walk through it, so it's my body chemistry that creates the distinctive scent. (I've noticed that it doesn't smell the same on others who wear it.)In any event, if Estee Lauder ever plans to discontinue it, put me down for a case.  I'll need a lifetime supply!",5.0
"My aunt loves it. However, the vendor took WAY too long in delivering it.",4.0

Excellent perfume-good price-quick shipment,5.0
The service was great but my wife did not like the new formula.  She has worn it since she was a teen so she knew right away they had changed the formula.,2.0
"I knew my girlfriend liked this perfume, but when I bought this for her for the first time, I had no idea how appreciative she would be..! I'll have to remember to keep this perfume well stocked in her bedroom..!  The subtle blend of cinnabar and her own personal scent is well beyond compare.  I'll never shop for another, since I smelled it in her hair...Well done, estee lauder..!!",5.0
Love the scent---not crazy about the new bottle.,3.0
Nice strong winter scent. I used to buy KL but at $300. uh no. This is close but always has the excellence of anything by Estee Lauder. There's a reason this perfume has lasted a long period of time. It's time tested and true and doesn't ware off! A must have for winter!,5.0
Love love love!!! Definitely the original scent and will be ordering again!!! Just in time for the fall/winter üòç,5.0
"Cinnabar is by far my girlfriends favorite perfume, & I am most satisfied with it as  Well. The fragrance is subtle & not so overwhelming but very nice to the senses.",4.0
"I am concerned to read that Cinnabar is becoming hard to find. Someone said in an earlier review that it has been around since 1978, but I am sure I have been wearing it since the early '70's, and I was not aware of it being a new fragrance at that time. I have read elsewhere that is is one of Estee Lauder's foundational fragrances, and has such a solid following that it is no longer advertised, but this is the first I've heard that it has become hard to come by. I usually buy at least a couple of bottles at a time, thus I don't need to restock very often, so this is news to me. Also, it seems the price has gone up substantially since I last purchased. I hate to see the price increase-- it was pricey enough before-- but alas, I am hooked on the stuff.It's difficult to describe a fragrance, and this one is truly unique; it is spicy as opposed to floral, however, it takes on its own nuance with each wearer. And though not overbearing, it is a long lasting fragrance; a light spritz in the morning will last throughout the day.I simply love, love, love this fragrance; there is nothing else like it, and in all these years I have never tired of it. It will come as no surprise that I highly recommend this fragrance, and certainly do not want to see it taken off the market.Update 8 September 2012: The prices I am seeing for this product on Amazon are crazy; one seller is asking $69.99 per bottle! Cinnabar is available through the Estee Lauder web site, priced at $42.00 a bottle, with free shipping, free gift wrap (if requested), no sales tax, and the usual freebie offers and samples-- I just ordered some today. Only the fragrance is offered now, apparently, the lotion and powder are no longer available, howeever many of the reviews request they be brought back, so maybe it will help. If you love Cinnabar, it might be worth adding your voice to the reviews there, to let Estee Lauder know; maybe it will make a difference.",5.0
Not the same scent that I remember,2.0
"I remember when Cinnabar first came out, and now (in my 60s) when I wanted a fragrance, I test a huge stack of scents and Cinnabar won hands down.  I just love it, not everyone is an spice/oriental scent person, and it is strong, but if you do... try a sample!",5.0

My husband purchased this scent for me 30 yrs ago.  This Cinnabar smells as lovely as the original Cinnabar.  However it doesn't have the stay power as the original so I gave it 1 less star.,4.0
"I encountered another woman the other day who had such a nice 'incensey' fragrance on ... then I rememberd Cinnabar and ordered this bottle.So glad they still make it - it was not easy to find.

My daughter and I weren't aware of the change in Cinnabar until we smelled this.  It's ok but not as good as the original.,2.0
"I have worn this perfume for over 30 years. As someone said as long as they make it I will buy it.A little spritz on my temples at the hairline is all I use daily and not a day goes by without someone commenting on how nice I smell.Macy's in the mall is the only place that sells it in my city, so buying it here is a life saver.Buy it, I will never wear any other perfume. They stopped selling the purse size and when I thought about it probably because there is no need to replenish it, very little goes a long way.The lotion is exquite also, do they still make that? Must go look. I will purchase also if they have.",5.0

"This is a signature fragrance. I started wearing Cinnabar in 1980. It is a warm, smooth, spicy fragrance NOT the kind that is so sharp that it burns the eyes and nose and gives people headaches. It is the only fragrance you really need for summer and winter. People say, ""Mmmm, you always smell so good,"" or ""That is your scent---I would recognize it anywhere.""",5.0
This perfume has a wonderful spicy smell.  It has been my wife's favorite for many years.  It has become hard to locate of late.,5.0

My husband's cousin uses it and and she sits 3 pews in front of us at church and I can still smell it.  It's just that strong folks and VERY SPICY SMELLING!
