Not sure why some people got a bad perfume. I got 2 great bottles. I sprayed the Modern Muse sample I was given at the major department store on one wrist and the Amazon Modern Muse on the other wrist and they smell the same. 4 hours later and the bottle sprayed wrist (the Amazon one) is still going strong compared to the sample I was given at the major department store. Maybe I was lucky to get the real deal perfume bottles through Amazon. I bought 2 bottles through Amazon for the price of one at a department store. One bottle is to gift to my Mother In Law and the other bottle is for me to keep. I give it 5 stars all the way with this purchase.,5.0
The smell doesnt persist. Its gone after 3 hours.,3.0

"I am pleased with this parfum, however it seems that the scent does not last once it is sprayed on. I have yet to receive a compliment on it. I am still glad that I purchased it though.

"The Modern Muse Parfum by Est√©e Lauder is wonderful! I was impressed by how quickly I received it and by the actual size. The bottle is beautiful and the quality of the perfume is excellent. I was wearing it one day when I was helping my four year old great granddaughter get dressed. She looked at me and said, ""you smell good, Gigi"". And she has a great nose! I am really pleased with the quality, the price and the delivery.",5.0
"This is such a beautiful scent! I first tried this a couple of years ago and didn't have the money to repurchase it that when I finally found myself able to again I was ecstatic. I nearly cried when I spritzed it on again after so long without it because the scent brings me such happiness, I was giddy to say the least. It's a beautiful scent reminiscent of honeysuckle and summer days from when I was a kid. it's not heavy yet it lasts all day. Definitely going to be made into my signature scent.",5.0
"Sweet and haunting. SUCH an improvement in Estee Lauder's line. To me, all of their recent fragrances have been very generic and drugstore-ish. This is the best and most ""high end"" smelling one since Cinnabar. I get a honeysuckle/tuber rose/jasmine odor which is just beautiful. Wish it lingered longer but really no complaints. Keep it in inventory, Amazon!",5.0
"I get more compliments on this perfume than any I have ever worn before in my life.  The aroma is elegant and fresh with just a hint of a floral undertone..... but so unlike any other fragrance that anyone in my office wears.  I read that a lot of people say that it doesn't last long, and I often feel that way as well, but even after I feel like its worn off because I can no longer smell it, I'm still getting compliments, so I think its more that I'm just use to the smell.",5.0
Good,5.0
"Great scent for young professionals. Light scent does not last as long as I would like, but it i do love the smell.",4.0
I have gotten a lot of compliments from wearing this perfume. My only downside about this is I have read Estee Launder has gone back to animal testing so in the future I will not be buying her products unless this is refuted.,3.0
Love this perfume. I was looking for a replacement to my Ralph Lauren Style that was discontinued and this one is very similar.,4.0
"Beautiful scent and receive comments whenever I wear it, which happens to be every day.",5.0
"Not very strong, but still good. It lasts just a few hours",3.0
Nice clean refreshing smell that goes well with my chemistry. Others find it pleasantly refreshing. I would recomend this for older ladies who just want to feel fresh after a shower and a few short sweet squirts.,5.0
"Since I love Estee Lauder and have Beautiful, Pleasures, Sensuous Nude and Pleasures Bloom I just had to have their new scent Modern Muse.  From the very first time I smelled it to now I just love it.  It is a very shy, quiet floral with a strong woodsy undertone.  My husband loves it on me and I love it too.  Estee Lauder has managed to create another classic.  What do you expect from them?  For the young and young at heart you can't go wrong with this one!",5.0
"I was delighted and burst out laughing when I just now opened the box--the bottle is HUGE, the biggest perfume bottle I have ever owned, and it is not the eau de toilette, it is the full parfum, so I am thrilled.  The price is fantastic, and while I have been burned with a counterfeit product years ago by a seller that is long gone now, this is definitely the real product and not faux.  As for the perfume itself, I have been stopped by women telling me how nice the scent is, asking me what it is.  This is by far the loveliest scent for me from Estee Lauder, it just works with my chemistry and is a year round appropriate scent.  It doesn't have a floral overload, which does not do well with my body chemistry, perhaps there is a trace of sandalwood/vanilla undertone to balance the often overly sweet florals out right now.  I tend towards heavier fragrances, like Armani Mania/Code, Calvin's Euphoria, my husband's YSL L'Homme that I put in my hair sometimes, and I love Miss Dior on the lighter end.  If you are a fan of Miss Dior, you will love Modern Muse.  I would place it in the same spectrum of Miss Dior and possibly Armani Acqua di Gioia.  Get a rollerball of Modern Muse too, you will never leave home without it, perfect for reducing stress whilst sitting in traffic, as it transports to a clean charming luxe headspace.",5.0
"First day I had this product, it fell over on my countertop and BROKE IN HALF, spilled everywhere, down the drain.I've had a hundred different perfume bottles and not one of them has ever broken, and had fallen in much worse conditions.  Very dispaointed in the bottle design, very expensive to have had it for only 1 day!!!!!!",1.0
"I received constant compliments on this perfume at my wedding from guests I walked by, and would buy it again in an instant. I specifically bought this after trying tons of perfumes because it worked with my pheromones and my now-husband is picky about perfumes. The scent is a delicate mixture of Jasmine undertones with light spiced scents.You cannot smell any alcohol in it at all, and the scent is lasting. The scent is exudes elegance and class and I made the perfect choice for my bridal perfume.",5.0
"This perfume is not legit at all. It smells for about 5 seconds and then you can't smell it anymore. We compared it to a store model and also purchased a bottle and there is 100% zero doubt that this is counterfeit. I was also not allowed to return the item because of ""special shipping"" circumstances. Never again. Please do not buy. Spend the extra 30 dollars. You will be glad you did. If I could give 0 stars I would.",1.0
"I have always been a user of Estee Lauder products, at least I was.  One of the best things about Lauder fragrances was that you could always catch the scent on your skin from the moment you sprayed it to the moment your head touched the pillow.  Apparently, that is no longer the case. I recently purchased Modern Muse, one of  their newer scents.  I was very taken by the scent, thought it was one of the best they'd introduced.  After I sprayed the bottle and applied it to my arms and neck, I was quite impressed by the fragrance.  Very soon afterwards, not much more than an hour, the scent had disappeared almost completely.  Talk about watering down a product!  I was truly disappointed.  I don't believe I will bother to even test an Estee Lauder fragrance going forward.  I don't want to get 'taken' again. I'll go back to Calvin Klein's Obsession.  At least I know I'm wearing perfume that doesn't wear off in record short time.  So disappointing, Estee Lauder!  Sorry it's to late to return.",2.0
"This is not the real thing!!!!! It fads away as soon as you spray and it isn't exactly the right odor.  This is a rip-off big time, I paid almost $100 for this and is nothing but a knockoff.  It is water with a little Modern Muse added.  I am so disappointed in Amazon.",1.0
Very disappointed in this product...some may receive the real ESTEE LAUDER Modern Muse but my bottle is a knock-off.  Really tried to give it the benefit of doubt but after going back to actual Estee Lauder Modern Muse from a department store it is easy to tell this bottle is not the same.,1.0
This is NOT the real thing. I have been wearing this for 3 years.  I can spray this one on and can't even smell it. I do not recommend ordering from this site.,1.0
Love Modern Muse but this is not the original.  The sent goes away almost immediately.  I have older bottles of perfume that last longer.  Very disappointed.  Will not buy again.  From other reviews I am guessing that it comes from different places some are good and some are not worth the money.,1.0
"I purchased Estee Lauder Muse perfume after sniffing samples in Vogue and Marie Claire magazines.  The smooth floral and slightly spicy fragrance adds an essential feminine touch for my days at the office and smells equally delicious with that little black dress for a night at the club.I do have to re-touch it during the day, but that's probably my individual skin absorption.  It wears down from floral to slightly spicy (think it might have sandalwood in it?) by noon.  Always smells rich, though.",5.0
This is a fake perfume . I was totally disappointed after using this .. It does not even stay on  for 5 mins .. I know this because I have bought the same one from the store and that stayed  on the whole day .... waste of my money ...,1.0
Very disappointed with this product. It's a knockoff. No lasting aroma at all. Will not purchase here in the future.,1.0
I get a lot of compliments on this smell it's a great flowered smell when you first put it on and then a little bit of woody notes afterwards which is what I'm looking for... this is my second bottle,5.0
"***UPDATE****I just purchased and received my 3rd bottle!Still loving this fragrance and the seller!*I am VERY pleased with my purchase! I bought this for myself because it is one of my favorite fragrances at a fraction of the normal retail cost!I was hesitate because of some of the reviews stating it wasn't real and that the verification barcode had been tampered with.I worked in cosmetics and in fragrance department stores and I know when something is fake, this product is definitely authentic, it was in correct packaging with the accurate barcode. The product also arrived on time! I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!",5.0

"Bought this for my wife. She loves this perfume and loved the price. This is another one of those: ""I didn't know Amazon had this"" moments. Purchased to add to her ""stock"".",5.0
"Extremely concerned due to the fact that it is under review by Amazon.  I have no idea what that means and am now afraid to wear it.  Would like to know what the actual problem is and whether it can be harmful.  If it is fake, that means the ingredients could be harmful.  Very, very concerned.",4.0
i gave you 1 star because you just left the product out of the building which is a big issue in my neighborhood,1.0
This is probably one of my favorite scents. I first discovered Modern Muse when I was given a sample version as a gift. I went ahead to buy this product and I can't complain. It's a lot bigger than i expected but it smells greats. The scent doesn't seem to stay on for too long though. I use it as my everyday perfume - very light and fresh.,5.0

This didn't smell like Est√©e Lauder Modern Muse I smelled at Macy's or Nordstrom.  Alcohol content seemed high and the smell didn't even last.,1.0
"My wife has been using modern muse for a very long time, This recent purchase smelled different, watered down and not matching the typical authentic smell. She did a blind test and sure enough this product is not the same, it takes 4-5 sprays to get close to the original. We cannot believe that Amazon allows counterfeit products to be sold. Perhaps we got a fake or bad batch, it was a birthday present that took us past the eligible return date.",1.0
"One month after purchased the smell changed. First I thought it was my laundry detergent, leaving my clothes smelling musky, but no, it was the perfume. I believe it was just old.",1.0
This is my favorite perfume so far. I bought it original from Macy's double price but this one I bought it from Amazon.com was not the same I realized right away. It doesn't smell strong and deep at all. Its definitely FAKE.,1.0
I love this scent.  My product arrived in excellent condition and on time.  Thank you.,5.0
"I've always liked Estee Lauder perfumes but often thought they were ""just too strong.""  Modern Muse is a much lighter and more floral scent.  Liked it so much I changed my perfume brand for the first time in many years.",5.0

Disappointed with my purchase...I have noticed that it doesn't stay on. Smells somewhat right from the bottle but doesn't stay on. I love Modern Muse and wear it all the time but something just isn't right with this bottle.,1.0
I bought Modern Muse for my mom as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loves it.  The price was excellent compared to what it would cost locally.  I totally recommend this to others,5.0

"I have purchased Estee Lauder fragrances since I was 18 and that means fifty years experience,  Try as I might,  I cannot even smell this fragrance.  I think they sold me water.  I will continue to buy tried and true fragrances inclusive of the ones I enjoy by Estee Lauder and other expensive parfums but, NOT this watered down no smell fragrance!",1.0
"In love with the smell of it, just magical and stays for a long long time. I would say it stay for more than 2 days on the dress. Highly recommended.",4.0
"I was given a sample of this new fragrance and love it.  It has a light, slightly flowery, but very clean fragrance.  I have been stopped twice by two women and asked what I was wearing.  They loved it too!!!  I cannot review how long it lasts, as I usually apply it in the afternoon and it seems to last long into the night.",5.0
"This is without a doubt one of the most lovely perfumes I have used. It has an elegant and refined quality, without being high strung or up tight. It smells clean and floral, but has a touch of a woodsy, almost musky heart. This fragrance makes me feel mature, but it is not too rich to wear during the daytime. I first had it as a sample, and loved it enough to purchase the full sized version. It's now becoming my signature scent, I will definitely buy again.",5.0

"When I tried it at the Belks counter just for the heck of it, I fell in love. My painter who was driving me that day ( I had pneumonia) fell in love. When everytime I go out, men and women alike compliment you on your scent and ask the name, well it speaks volumes ladies ;)",5.0
