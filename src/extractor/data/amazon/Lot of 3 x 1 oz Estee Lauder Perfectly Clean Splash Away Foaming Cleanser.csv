"Not sure if this was legit product...containers seemed less then full, 1 was smooth (which I wanted) 2 were gritty like a scrub.  Definitely not like the original product I was familiar with.  Smelled good tho.",2.0
This is the best sample from Estee Lauder. It's so luxurious and the size of the tubes for the price turned out to be a very good deal. Only use a little bit! I liked to never rinsed my face the first time I used it.,5.0

I get this and a few other estee products for my aunt every Christmas. For a women with expensive test this item doesn't break my budget Plus she swears by it. I buy the little ones so she can take them with her in her purse and theres less ounces in the bigger one than these,4.0
"It leaves your skin so clean and it is soft and creamy. I like the little containers even better than large one: for shower, suitcase, and gym bag. I've got very sensitive skin and it cleans without harm to delicate skin",5.0
I thought this formula would be exfoliating like the Estee Lauder cleanser I tried a couple of years ago in a gift with purchase. This cleanser is a little drying and not anything particularly great for the price of the full size product. These were small and cheap and a good way to try the product but I think I'll pass on a full size purchase.,3.0
Great for travel!,5.0

"I first tried this product when I received a free sample with an order from Estee Lauder.  I really like the way it smells - nice and clean - but was most happy with how well it removes my makeup.  This doesn't dry your face out, nor is it oily - pretty perfect for normal skin. Because of the foaming action, a very tiny amount goes a long way.One 1 oz bottle lasted at least a month.",4.0
"The actual product itself cleans very good without drying. This review is for the samples I received. I originally had a sample from my mom which she got in Macys during Christmas. That 1oz bottle lasted two months however these seem to not have nearly as much cream inside the bottle. After about three or four uses, you really have to squeeze. Seems more like half an ounce to me.",3.0
It's authentic but the amount in each tube is very tinny seems like half of the lotion is taken out. It's not worth it. Will not buy again. Will just buy from the official website or store.,3.0
This my regular purchase with Amazon and love to use this even for men,5.0

"I love this face wash, but I don't particularly love the small sizing. It seems like there's not enough product in the tubes, they are all half full and don't last. I bought it specifically for travel.",3.0

This product is a miracle worker. I have been battleing acne for all of my teenage life. Ive used products from clearasil to Loreal it either makes me breakout more or nothing at all. Not only does it get rid of pimples it helps clear up black spots too. Ive finally found a product that works for ME,5.0
good!,4.0
Amazing amazing product. So smooth the skin feels after using this and also reduces darkness.,5.0
