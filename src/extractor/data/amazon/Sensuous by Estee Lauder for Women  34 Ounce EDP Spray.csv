"I've purchased Estee Lauder Sensuous directly from amazon. The box and bottle were original, however, the perfume was just water with a tablespoon of sugar. Also the ""new"" bottle was worn out around the lead and letters on the bottle were worn out in places. I've contacted amazon and they refunded my money immediately and told me I can keep the perfume. I appreciate prompt refund but so called perfume is useless. I am not trying to discourage anyone from shopping, just make sure you have a refund option in case something is wrong.",1.0
Sensuous by Estee Lauder has been my favorite perfume for quite some time. I adore sandalwood. The last time I purchased my perfume was a little over a year ago. The best thing about it was it's lasting ability. I would spray a small amount and could still smell it when I woke up the next morning. With this bottle the scent disappears off of my skin faster than much cheaper body sprays. I'm not sure if I received a lesser quality product or if Estee Lauder has changed their formula. The scent is still heavenly but I wish it lived up to my past experiences.,2.0
"I have been buying this perfume periodically for many years. They do not admit it, but they have changed the formula. It smells the same but is much more faint. Does not last at all. It seems as if they have added water to stretch the product and (I guess) increase the profits. Shame......time to find a new perfume.",2.0
"This is an amazing scent that changes as it warms and adjusts to your body chemistry.  Beautiful when it goes on, it softens and grows deeper throughout the day.  I don't find that it fades any more than any other perfume, but I have found myself unconsciously enjoying the scent at random moments, which takes me by pleasant surprise.  I will buy this scent again and again, it's wonderful.",5.0
"Sensuous smells exactly like its namesake; this is one of those linear fragrances that don’t evolve very much but it smells so amazing that it doesn’t matter. This was close to becoming my signature scent, but I found it rather difficult to wear on a daily basis. It’s something that I reach for at night, after a hot shower…before bed, or for a quiet evening out with my husband.Sensuous starts with a blast of sandalwood and cedar, these are the primary notes that you can pick out among the mellowing warmth of honey and amber. I sense a little pepper in between but it complements the woodiness of this fragrance so well that you can hardly separate the two. There is a bit of orange on the cool down but it’s very subtle, I feel like it helps to give a clean powdery feeling to the structure of this perfume. With the exception of ylang-ylang, I did not detect any florals.I consider Sensuous to be one of my top five powdery fragrances, it’s definitely unlike anything I’ve ever smelled before and I feel this is due to the unique nature of its ingredients. The honey and amber radiates with warmth and sensuality, it reminds me of silk sheets and vanilla body cream, very luxurious and decadent. At its heart this is a boozy powder with balsamic undertones and a hint of warm incense, it’s very feminine but not immature; this is a woman’s fragrance.Overall I find myself being completely enamored with Sensuous; as the seasons shift into December I find myself embracing it like a warm blanket before a roaring fire. I can’t imagine myself wearing this during the summer months but it seems fitting for autumn and winter. Sillage and longevity are moderate, this is a skin scent meant to entice and seduce with ease; apparently it works…I am constantly under its spell!Top NotesJasmine /Magnolia /LilyMiddle NotesAmber /Woodsy Notes /Ylang-YlangBase NotesSandalwood /Mandarin /Orange /Pepper /HoneyVienna.Pink << For all my Fragrance Reviews!",5.0
"Absolutely love this perfume!!  Get lots of compliments when I wear it, it smells amazing and it's very sublte so it's not overwhelming to other people when I wear it!  $20 cheaper here then purchasing in the department store and yes this is the real thing!",5.0

"As others have said, this Eau de Parfum does not last.  I first tried it at the Estee Lauder counter, and it lasted a good long time on my wrists.  I thought it smelled heavenly, sort of layered and with a holiday overtone, but the first time I tried it at home, the scent left immediately, so I thought I just put it on too lightly, and the next time, I really spritzed it on generously, along with the scented powder.  Thirty minutes later, nothing.I know that body chemistry plays a large part in how long a perfume lasts on anyone, but I did expect this to perform identically to the one I tried at the perfume counter.",1.0

"I'll preface this by saying I used to steal this perfume from my mom when I was in high school and now it's my favorite scent!!! It's honestly so beautiful and warm. And as other reviewers have said, men love it!! My boyfriend detests every perfume except this scent, he says it's the only perfume he's ever been attracted to! For those disappointed with its ""longevity"", you have obviously never bought this at the Estée Lauder counter where they explicitly tell you how these scents work. It does in fact stay on you all day (just smell your clothes the next day if you don't believe me), you become used to the scent and it ""wears with you"" but it's still there!",5.0

"This fragrance is my absolute favorite..and while I acknowledge the other reviewers' disappointment with its longevity, I have to say... I LOVE that it doesn't last all day!  If it did, then anyone who was near me when I first sprayed it on would be getting a noseful for an hour!  I am, quite frankly, tired of overpowering fragrances, they are my pet peeve... so you need to spray a little more on a few hours later - don't we do that anyway??? What sold me on Sensuous is that I get compliments EVERY time I wear it, which is not an exaggeration, and the fact that I am not enveloping myself and others in a cloud of fragrance is, I think, the reason.  Try it..it's subtle, but it's not, IMO, watered down.. just a great scent..you WILL get compliments!",5.0

"If you have the opportunity to buy it at a 50% discount (check Ebay), the wonderful fragrance might be worth it. Only purchase Estee Lauder Sensuous ETP if you don't mind that the fragrance will fade quickly leaving only a slight scent after an hour or so. The good thing is it goes on light, so it's safe to spritz just prior to a romantic encounter. Just don't expect it to last all night (or even through dinner).",3.0
"WHAT has happened with Estee Lauder fragrances??? As a faithful customer, I remember times when I had to CAREFULLY spray tiny droplets of Private Collection or Estee because the fragrances were so powerful and LONGGG-lasting. I recently purchased Sensuous...including the body lotion...and received the shock of my life. The fragrance is INCREDIBLE, but it evaporated within TWO hours...definitely NOT a trademark of traditional Estee Lauder. I was completely disappointed and relayed my dismay to the salesperson. She, in turn, confided that MANY customers had that complaint. With the real Estee now passed on, I hope her company is not adopting the attitude that diluting scents is a quick way to make money. It is a quicker way of losing long-time customers!! I understand that Givenchy's L'Interdit was noticeably changed (diluted) and lost a considerable number of faithful wearers (myself included). I view and wear my fragrances as carefully as I choose my jewelry...both are accessories that speak TO me and ABOUT me. I never thought I'd be saying this about an Estee Lauder product, but if I cannot trust my fragrance to LAST, then why even BUY IT?? If I wanted CHEAP, I'd get it at a drugstore!",1.0
"One of my all-time FAVORITES !Sooooooooooo delicious ~ I have so many to choose from and lately, I keep coming back to this one... It's especially warm, lingering, intoxicating, sexy and of course, sensuous. Perfectly named & captured. I like the ""wavy"" bottle, too.My (and someone else's) current favorite.Thank you, Estee ~ it's lovely",5.0
"This is the most sensual perfume I have ever smelled.  I found this perfume to be light and not overpowering to the senses.  This perfume is subtle and after it sits on my ladies skin for an hour I will say that it is hard to keep my hands off of her.  The smell is very attractive, not cloying or allergy inducing like so many over powering fruity smells out there today.  This is a classy smelling perfume and never fails to raise my interest.",5.0
"One of my favorites...I HATE HATE HATE old lady perfume. Like Opium and all those HEAVY stinking perfumes women seem to want to take a bath in. This is not a fruity light perfume. It is actually exactly what the name says ""SENSUSOUS""  I get compliments on it all the time. From younger women and older women. Its worth every penny. It lasts all day long. Its definitely NOT old lady perfume. My mother use to wear a perfume called ""Youth Dew"" by Este Lauder....it was nauseating. So, I never really like anything from Este Lauder. Everything they make is so heavy and old lady-ish. This is a wonderful....sensesous scent. Buy it , you won't regret it.",5.0
Yes...saved me about 40.00 ..The big Dept. Store only sell it in large size...I am retired and do not wear everyday...,5.0
"I am giving this perfume a 5 star review because it smells EXACTLY like Tuscanny per Donna, which I used to wear years ago.  My mom just bought this scent and I always sample all of her new perfumes and I was FLOORED when I sprayed this on.  I had to look and see if Tuscanny was actually discontinued because this perfume smells EXACTLY like it!  Tuscanny is still available which is odd because they smell so much alike.  However I love Tuscanny and I love this one and to the reviewer who said that it evaporated within a very short time, I sprayed a small spritz of this at lunchtime on my wrist and it's now almost quitting time and I still smell it going strong.  Everyone's chemistry is different...it will smell and last differently on each individual who uses it.",5.0
"I sprayed this on me and went browsing for a few. At first it was a bit strong, uh-oh, but that very quickly passed and what it dried down to was absolutely wonderful. This is a very different fragrance from Estee Lauder compared to any of the previous ones. I would have never thought I would love an Estee Lauder fragrance as much as much as this. It is multi-faceted - soft, sexy, playful, flirtatious, rich, sweet, spicy, warm, lightly floral and has great staying power. The blend of notes in this non-traditional way becomes something beautiful. I layer this perfume with the lotion; it is wonderful, absorbs quickly and has a very slight shimmer. Try this, you will not be disappointed - it is wonderful.",5.0
"This is nothing like sensuous! There is no scent, essentially spray on rubbing alcohol. :(",1.0
"Sorry to say.. I expected better than that... looked so long for it. It was like a fragrance in WATER... scent lasted no time.... was really disappointed. but, I appreciate the fact that Amazon corrected it by refunding my money. I'm still going to be a loyal customer of Amazon. Just think I'll stay away from the (PARFUM) ( it's like toilet water.",1.0

"Most people know Estee Lauder for their classic fragrances; Cinnabar, Youth Dew, Spell Bound, White Linen and now Beautiful. This is one of the big up and coming fragrances that has been on the market for only about 4 years. It does have a rich woodsy smell, with a dash of spice. Do not expect the classic three note fragrance, with top and bottom notes; you will not find it.It does not wear well on some people; particularly older woman over 50. I personally think it is most appropriate for women in the mid to late 20s, 30s and early 40s and is more of a winter fragrance. There is little need for layering with Sensuous, but the shimmer lotion is the best way to go if you do. Additionally, I use the roller pen over the sprays when I can-it tends to last longer and wear a little better.",5.0

"To start, I am super sensitive to fragrances, usually ending up with a headache from even the faintest of sprays. I tried this with great trepidation, as all of E.L.s other fragrances are strong and overpowering for me. But, being both an unapologetic Estee girl and a beauty junkie, how could I not at least try?To say that I love this fragrance would be an understatement. I LOVE it.I haven't found it to be to heavy, and the scent lasts all day on me.The scent is warm, spicy, sweet... really, it's just amazingly complex and pretty. Finally, I can proudly proclaim that I too have a signature scent!",5.0
Beautiful scent! One of the best perfumes ever! The smell only lasts half a day but it is one of the best scents I have ever worn!,5.0
This perfume smells SOOOO good. Its not too heavy (I hate heavy perfume)and I find that it lasts--I feel the spray lasts longer than the roll-on. Actually I haven't even bought real perfume in years because most are too strong for me. This is the first one so that's saying a lot for me.,5.0
Absolutely love this fragrance!,5.0
"Not a fan of this fragrance. The sandalwood musky scent is super light...way too light for my taste. I needed to apply a very generous amount before I could even smell it. Then, the small amount of fragrance that this perfume put out vanished within 30 minutes. I do not recommend.",2.0

"I tried the new perfume by Estee Lauder, ""Sensuous"" -it smelled really great in the store and I thought that this was really for me but when I purchased it, I was disappointed to note that this fragrance did not last.  Thought this to be unusual for a fragrance by Estee Lauder!  I am sorry I purchased it. I realize now that I am not the only one that is disappointed since I've heard of others.",1.0
"Like the previous reviews, I, too, found the scent to last one-two hours.  I was told by the sales lady that they were having a hard time keeping this fragrance in stock.  Well as much as love the scent, I won't be buying it again.  Perfume is expensive and quite honestly, I want something that's going to last longer than an hour or two.",1.0
