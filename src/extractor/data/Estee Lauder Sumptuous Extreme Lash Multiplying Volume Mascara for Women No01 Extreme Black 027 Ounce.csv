"Good coverage but if I apply early in the morning and am going out in the evening, I need to touch up but I think its like that with most mascaras.",4.0
I have tried many mascara brands over the years and this is by far my favorite. I often have people ask my what kind of mascara I am wearing. Don't waste your money on anything else.,5.0
Nice product.,5.0

"I love this mascara! ! No clumping,  just long, full eye lashes.",5.0
"I've tried many, many mascaras and this one doesn't flake or clump when I use it.  It makes my eyelashes look very long, too.",5.0
"As others mentioned, which I did not heed, this is trial size and not as pictured. Totally false advertising and Amazon should remove them as a vendor.",1.0
"Picture shows regular size mascara ,however what you get is trial size, not for sale. Amazon should not be in buiseness with this retailer. Regular size mascara at Macy's store 26 $, this 10 x less 16$. Please do not order from this retailer. I should have read the reviews.",1.0
"Dramatic lashes! This is the one for dark, thick, big lashes. I love this mascara. My lashes don't feel brittle, it doesn't flake. My only complaint is that it doesn't separate very well. It is a wet formula and can be too much if you put on too many layers. It isn't a clumpy mascara but it doesn't separate the individual lashes out as much as I would like. It does lengthen and thicken your lashes to almost false lash level. Lashes are still soft. The formula lasts all day.",5.0
"This is a wonderful product, and I would very much recommend it to anyone, but the order was a complete disappointment. The mascara turned out to be a sample size of 1 oz, without a box, which is not what I wanted. Besides, it looks used! How annoying.",1.0
"I have tried several mascaras over the years, and the Sumptuous continues to remain my favorite. Any time I've strayed away from it, I've regretted it, and I've come back to it.",5.0
This is the only mascara I've found that does not flake throughout the day. If you have oily skin this mascara will still stay put. My favorite mascara!,5.0
"Expensive and you have to apply it twice to see the difference, But it works with 2 coats",4.0
"Veeeeery disappointed! I ordered regular size mascara - 2pc, and received 2 small ones,not packed in a original box and 'not for individual sale'. Looks like I'm a 2nd personwho got wrong item. I don't recommend this supplier.",1.0
I never have spent more than 11 bucks on mascara in my 33 years on this planet. Boy was I wrong! This puts every mascara I have ever used to shame. 5 stars!,5.0
"This mascara is a great volumuous mascara, it builds thickness and length to the lashes. It leaves the lashes natural feeling and does not smudge. I will be a repeat customer!!!!",5.0
"This is the worst mascara I have ever used. I have used Estee Lauder before and it was OK--not great, but not awful. Then I got 2 tubes of this.  The first time I opened them, they seemed to be many years old. They were dry and had many clumps. I couldn't get it on without making a big mess on my face. Then I had to wipe it off and put on more eye shadow and once, start all over again. I am taking these back to Estee Lauder and have them throw them away so they get the point. Don't buy.",1.0
"I have ordered an original size mascara and i have payed as an original size costed, but i have received small size item not for individual sale. also it has not any invoice indicated size, type and price of the product. very disappointed",1.0
If you are looking for volume safely this is the go to mascara. I have used it for years and I have sensitive skin! I have less lines underneath my eyes than the majority of women my age. It does not run or clump and comes off with warm water!,5.0
It is good but I would like a wand that wasn't so thick,3.0
"Bought this from a department store. But this is my absolute favorite mascara. People have been asking if I am wearing fake eyelashes. It makes my lashes look both thick and long, with no clumping or flaking. I really love this mascara. It is worth every penny, and this is coming from a girl who only buys drug store makeup. I will definitely buy again and again!",5.0
Not that great mascara. Very clumpy & doesn't say what it says it does,1.0
"good product, but clumps",3.0
I think this mascara had great potential but it seemed a bit 'dried' out when I got it..frustrating.,3.0
most fave mascara!,5.0
I recieved a sample of this and used it once. The next morning I woke up to discover hives under both set of lashes. I have tried many many mascaras of various price rages and have never ever had a reaction before.,1.0
"This bra is nicely made with great feel. Unfortunately it was a little too tight for me (I'm normally 32 C, but the 32C of this brand/design was tight ).",4.0
