"Been using this product for over 10 years ans always buy at the EL counter in-store at Macys or Nordstrom. Firs time buying online. I believe 100% this is FAKE! It doesn't  have the same smell; its waaaaay thinner; the bottle color, weight of the glass us lighter; the cap is a lighter gold and the EL LOGO on the lid is not clearly stamped; the pump is cheap and different also in size; the glass is tooled differently and has a clear seem on the right side, no bottle is like this and i compared them all to four almost  empty bottles (I try to get out of it as much as i can.) i have. I took it to Macys and they compared it too and thought it was fake as well. It came in a legit looking box which I regrettably threw away. Otherwise I would have returned it. I don't know what product other people are getting that gave it more than one star. I have been ripped off and this product isn't fooling this EL customer. Pumps differnt in size smaller one is from EL.Com and fake lid doesnt fit on the real bottle.",1.0
"This is probably the only product I have purchased on Amazon that isn't really any cheaper than to buy elsewhere. But, as I get gift cards for Amazon, I save them until I can order for free. I have used it for years and never noticed it reducing pore size, at all. BUT! I have super dry skin, alligator feeling, and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth. That makes it worth it to me. My step mom has always pooh, pooed my getting expensive skin creams. I had let myself run out of this, at one time, as wanted to see if I could find a less expensive substitute. I had her run her finger tips, lightly, over my forehead, so she could feel how rough my skin felt. Then when I started using this again, (after only 3 days of use) had her do the same again. She said, Wow, it really does make a difference! And this is from a woman that usually NEVER  admits being wrong.",5.0
"I received this as a free gift with purchase (sample-sized). As eloquent as I am, I CANNOT put into words how flawless this product makes my skin look and feel. This serum is AMAZING. I do not have skin issues,but I'm well beyond 40; this serum makes my skin smoother than silk! I apply argan oil over it at night and my skin is so supple and soft. When this sample is depleted, I WILL purchase the full-sized product. The sample has lasted me about a month, so the regular size should last a very long time for the price. I'm VERY IMPRESSED with this serum!!",5.0
"I didn't realize this was not the one usually soled at the make up counter, but this is the uni sex and that unfragranted version which has a completely different texture and feel compared to the regular idealist.  So that was completely my fault and nothing the company did wront.",1.0
This is not even close to the product you purchase in the department store. Much thinner and does not leave skin as silky smooth.Will not purchase again - got what I paid for.,1.0
Wouldn't recommend. I've used this product for 10 years now and this is the first time that I've been disappointed. The feel and scent are not the same as previous bottles I've used. It feels watery and it has no scent. The bottle details are not as fine as my other Idealist products. Could it have been a fake?I gave it a try for two weeks because someone said that it was the scent-free formula. Big mistake. I should have returned it immediately.,1.0
"This stuff is so expensive but I love it. I have been using it on and off since my 20's. I'm 38 and everyone thinks I'm 28. This stuff works, at least for me over night. I always look better when I use this product. Now, at 38, it's definitely worth the cash. Miracle in bottle.",5.0
Been using this for years. Nice at smoothing out the skin and adding moisture. Tried lots of alternative brands but I keep coming back to this one.,4.0
"I received THREE (3) bottles of this product in a goody bag, which allowed me ample time to try it and see if any pores were minimized. Sorry folks, I got no actual pore minimizing, no actual skin refinishing.What you get is the APPEARANCE of small pores and softer skin b/c of the thickish silicone film that you are rubbing all over your face, diffusing light and adding smoothness. Any type of silicone-based cream or primer will do this. But after you wash it off, your skin still remains the same. The sugar-based enzymes this product claims to have seems to be negated by the large amount of silicone.After going through 2 bottles of this and being really frustrated by the claims (which i feel are all visual perception claims, btw), i gave away the third bottle.",1.0
I really like this product! It minimize porce even my scars from acne. Really good stuff worth it every drop,5.0
"This is a miracle in a bottle.I am a loyal estee lauder customer for life. I started to using this back in my twenties but I always thought the product was okay being I didn't have any wrinkles ,yet.The only thing I noticed then was that I had a large scar on the tip of my finger.(The finger I used to dab the lotion on with). To my amazement it was completely gone.I must have been using this stuff for about a year before I noticed it.Then i realized my face wasn't as oily ,either.It really balanced my skin out perfectly.I'm now 39 years old and still use it just about every day and my skin is smooth. Never had any reactions or break outs to my sensitive skin. My friends from high school say I look the same.Love it!",5.0
"I bought this being a long time Idealist user because of the great price. I recieved the bottle in a highly mangled Idealist box. I was not too concerned about this as long as the product is good. Trying to apply, the pump was very tight, and eventually after a couple of days broke. I also noticed too that it had a different smell than I was use too. Looking at the pump, was not the typical EL pump. Makes me wonder if this was a knock off product.I will not order from this seller again.",1.0
This is not the same product I have been purchasing for years.  This was much thinner and did not make it easier to apply makeup. which is why I have been purchasing all these years.  This is a fake product.\,1.0
"Listen up, ladies: this is a pricey product and worth every dime you pay for it.I discovered Idealist on a shopping trip to Bloomingdales while I was looking for something else. I passed by the counter, spread a dab of this product on my hands and then on my face, touched my face a couple of minutes later to see how it felt and I went ""OOOOHHHHH!!"" Your face will feel like the finest silk and this is no exaggeration. I've been using it morning and night ever since and I absolutely love it. Clean your face well in the evening and put on a few drops of Idealist before you put on your moisturizer. In the morning, a little dab will set your face up for the day.I've tried and rejected a whole bunch of face care products but this one is definitely a keeper.Judy Lind",5.0
"This stuff works by using silicone (dimenthicone and polysilicone 11) to fill in the pores, however the effect is only temporary.  Once you wash it off, the pores open up again.  Also a check of the ingredients reveals quite a few naughty skin irritants.  So beware of what you put on your skin.",1.0
"You get what you pay for, and in this case, if you shell out some $$$ you'll get the benefits of an excellent serum. Idealist really does a great job of minimizing the appearance of pores, while softening and smoothing skin. It makes my makeup glide on effortlessly after I apply it. i highly recommend this stuff.",5.0
"This item arrived with the box in great shape but the pump on the bottle was broken and serum was leaking out.  The bottle was only half filled of serum, yet there was hardly any serum on the inside of the box which means it was previously opened before being mailed to me.  I've been buying this serum directly from Estee Lauder for years and this serum did not smell the same as what I get from Estee Lauder so it's probably not even the same product.",1.0
"After 2 weeks of religious use of this my husband commented on how smoth my skin looked. I hadn't told him that I switched products, so I got to put on my own EL commercial for him. :o) I simply love this stuff!! It just keeps improving my skin. I've had hyper pigmentation spots on my cheeks and forehead for 10 yrs now. After a month of using this my spots are almost completely faded! That alone makes it worth the money for me!",5.0
Love this. I have used this product for several years. I love how it makes my skin look and feel.,5.0
"I am a black woman with oily skin and enlarged pores around my nose. I used this product for the first time in 2006 and kept using it for years. Then I stopped for some cheaper alternative. I have eventually gotten back to it. For my skin, this is the ultimate product, my skin is never  as smooth, clear,  as when I use this product. It is costly but a little goes a very long way. It is worth the investment and works even better now that I am using the Advanced Night Repair serum from Estee Lauder along with it. A keeper for me, as long as I can afford it and as long as they keep making it.",5.0
"I've bought this product multiple times directly from department stores and decided to purchase from Amazon. This isn't the same as what I'm accustomed to - the consistency and smell is very different. This feels watery going on and smells perfumed. I wouldn't recommend buying this, it doesn't appear to be the real stuff.",1.0
"After reading a awesome rewievs about a product a was so excited to get it. But I was dissapointed, I've used the whole 1.7OZ boutle and it did nothing to my skin...

"The box and container were correct and as expected, but the contents were most certainly not the correct moisturizer. It was clear the bottle had been re-filled (though I'm not sure what with but it had a very different perfume/smell than it was supposed to).",1.0

"Hello, I just want to return my  item. The reason is - it's  gonna be  a present to my  friend and  we are bouth use this  product for a long time, so we know how does it look.  It seems to me the item I have recieved not a real Estee Lauder Idealist Pore Minimizing. So I  just want to return it and  get my  money back.  I also got a mascara as a gift with  this order. Could you please clarify if I need to return it too or can leave it as a moral compensation?",1.0
"I love love this stuff! I have huge pores and oily skin, my skin tone is so un even and feels horrible! From day one this product has made such a differance with my skin ( face and neck ) I will never not use this again, just put a little on after cleansing and before your mousiturizer!",5.0
"I happen to be a man who loves product. I have a combination, olive skintone that isn't sensitive or prone to breakouts. I have some moderate pores on my forehead and nose. Outside of tanning 3 times/month and smoking 5 cigarettes per day, I take extremely good care of my skin and really do look 5 to 10 years younger than my current 32 aged self. I've tried other pore refiners but always come back to this one. It makes my skin soft, minimizes the APPEARANCE of the pores, keeps my skin matte all day...it's really a stellar product, which I highly recommend.My equally product loving mother also raves about this and uses it under her makeup. She has about 28 more years of experimenting with product and a lot more money than I do. So, skip the rest, try this but be realistic about the fact that your pores will not disappear, they will just appear smaller. Great for combination skin, any age, male or female. (The Estee Lauder product in the brown packaging (eye cream and serum) are also top-tier products!)",5.0
"I have been using this product for over a year and since that time, have had so many compliments on my skin. I never received compliments on my skin before! I put some on after washing and toning my face, and just prior to adding moisturizer and makeup.  While I do not use EL moisturizer (I'm an Origins girl for skin cleansers and moisturizers), it works great with my moisturizer and under either my EL foundation or MAC foundation (depending on the day). It is the priciest beauty item I use, but it's also my secret weapon!",5.0
