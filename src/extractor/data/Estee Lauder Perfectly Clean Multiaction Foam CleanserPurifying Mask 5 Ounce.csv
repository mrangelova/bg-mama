It's for those who have dry skin as it really takes everything off. If you have dry skin this is not the best product,4.0
"This cleanser is great at keeping your skin soft and smooth.  But you can also use it as a masque and as a masque, it's lacking.  If you use it just to clean, it's hard to wash off (better use a washcloth).",3.0
"Great value, big bottle with small price. Many facial cleansers cause me acne , maybe because they destroy my acid barrier too much. I've been using this soap for months with no damage to my skin. leaves your skin feeling extra clean. This is the first facial cleanser to work for me.",5.0
"LOVE this product! It's the only one I have found so far that leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh and does not cause irritation. I've been using it for over 2 years, tried to compromise because of the price and bought something else one time, but it turns out I wasted my money. Love, love this product!",5.0

Very effective cleanser. Even removes eye makeup. Gentle on sensitive skin. It doesn't dry out skin but it doesn't moisturize either so I wouldn't recommend it for very dry skin. A small amount goes a long way.,4.0

This product is too strong for my skin which is oily and acne prone. It makes my face dry and it feels very hard after I use this. It does not remove dirt or make up. I gave it to my husband and he uses it as mask now and then as his skin is much thicker and tough than mine. I just did not want to waste it because I do love other Estée Lauder products.,2.0

"I'm torn because this is my favorite facial cleanser I have ever found- but being an animal advocate, I know Estee Lauder resumed animal testing, which obviously leaves a very sour taste in my mouth. Animal rights aside, this cleanser smells GREAT (something I didn't get when I was using Mary Kay's Timewise)...the best smelling facial cleanser I've ever used. It's like a cream when you squeeze it out, but as you massage it on your skin it becomes incredibly fluffy and silky. My skin has never had a reaction to it, and it leaves my face feeling clean and soft. l use this product with a separate cleanser to exfoliate.",4.0
"I absolutely love this product.  It has been the only thing that keeps my skin clear throughout my pregnancy! If I skip a day, its obvious. Pretty amazing stuff.",5.0

"This is my favorite brand of makeup & the best face wash I have found. It gets your face clean without leaving that slimy feeling. If you want a great foaming soap that does a great job of cleaning, this is it & worth it. A little drop goes a long way, plus I use it with my Clarisonic face scrubber, so all the makeup is gone. Then follow it with the Estee Lauder Re-Nutriv face creams. Moisturizing is so important, yes Mom, I listened.",5.0
"Cara here (using hubby's login). My absolutely favorite face wash. Ever. It doesn't dry out my face and washes away completely clean. I love how it foams and how it feels on my face. It has a nice fragrance as well. This new formulation functions as a masque, too. Once a week I wash and then leave on my face for a bit. I love this wash.",5.0
"This is my first time using this cleanser and I have to say that I really like it a lot.  The cleanser is creamy and I only need to use a small amount, maybe the size of a nickel and that does the job and doesn't dry out my skin.  I've normally bought drugstore cleansers in the past and this one is definitely more expensive; however I don't need to use as much so I won't need to buy new cleanser as often.  Will buy again.",5.0
I have used this product for many years so obviously I like it.  It removes my makeup completely.  It has a very pleasant fragrance and produces a nice cleansing foam when water is added to it on the face. It is not drying to my skin at all.  I am now in my 60's and wouldn't want a strong or drying cleanser.,5.0
Absolutely love this stuff. I have acne prone skin and my skin has never cleared up with other cleansers but this one is like gold to me. I went through 5 of these already and I use it twice a day. It removes even the thickest cake face and leaves your skin squeaky clean! I absolutely hate cleansers that leave a weird film. This is a definite must have,5.0
My sister left this behind on one of her many trips back to the city. This thing is absolutely magnificent OMGEEEEES. TALK  ABOUT FABULOUCIOUS.please don't use a lot because you'll only waste it. A pea size goes a LOOOOONNNNNG way. It's worth the price.Great at taking off makeup.Thanks a bunch Sis.,5.0
I love all Estée Lauder products and this one is awesome! Very gently removes daily grime. Does not dry your skin. Very subtle clean smell. Highly recommend it,5.0
"I am so shocked right now by how good this worked for me....I am a skin care JUNKY it's terrible...I do not care how much this product costs IT IS FREAKIN WORTH IT. It smells like extra clean linen <333333  SOO clean feeling and when you are washing it,it actually suds up and foams up so luxuriously it feels amazing...this is my first time using it tonight and I just washed my face really good with my spin brush but then it said you could leave it on as a mask too so I did that for like 1/2 the time it said to do.....its been about 2 hours and my acne marks are fading and my pores look like im 15 again...I really just thought a co worker was just trying to get a sale but i cant wait to see her to telll her how much I freakin love it. you will not regret purchasing this item just make sure you are getting it from a legit consumer.",5.0
I LOVE this creamy cleanser.  It doesn't take a lot to clean the makeup off your face and it leaves your skin silky soft.  It smells good too.  I highly recommend this cleanser. Well worth the price.,5.0
I have been using this cleanser for almost a year and there's nothing special to it. I don't see any improvement in my skin tone. I think the good side is that my skin is not against it either. 3 stars because it is expensive. I'm using this just to finish the tube and then will use another less expensive product from shiseido.,3.0
"This is really good if you have a greased T zone! This is the only soap that have worked for me. It seems expensive but, the cream is not runny like others so it lasts for more time than other brands.",5.0
This is my favorite product to wash my face with.  I was surprised when I saw it on Amazon.  It cleans my face well and smells very good.,5.0
Loved it! It is one of the products that actually helped clear up my skin. I don't have horrible acne but a few pimples come out here and there. I have very oily skin and this made me feel super clean afterwards. My boyfriend's mom gave a sample to me that they were handing out in the mall and i literally last me a month. I bought this one and it lasted me for about 2-3 months with me using it almost everyday.,5.0
One of my favorite cleansers. It has a faint smell but nothing bad and even though it is a bit pricier I think it evens out in the end because you only need to use such a small amount to wash your face. It leaves my face feeling clean and bright without the dryness or tightness of other cleansers I've tried. I can't speak for how well it removes makeup because I use an oil cleanser beforehand.,5.0
I am a huge fan of all things Estée Lauder but this simple cleanser is perfect for those with sensitive skin.,5.0
"This is my absolute favorite face wash in the history of ever. Lots of other brands leave my face either too dry, or they don't take off all my makeup, but this one is very gentle and removes all my makeup with one wash, minus maybe a few little pieces of stubborn mascara, but I usually finish taking that off with a wet hand towel. Also, this product smells incredible. I have been using it for about 6 years and haven't had a single desire to use anything else. Worth the price. Your face will thank me.",5.0
"A friend left a small size of this behind, I tried it & really liked it. It only takes a very small amount & feels good. It rinses off nicely without leaving a filmy feeling. I think it is well worth the price since I am using a smaller amount than I was of my previous cleanser & I like how it feels on my skin.",5.0
This is the one beauty product I spend good money on and it is worth every penny. This bottle lasts me about 6 months or more. I love it but wish they were exclusively cruelty free.,5.0

"It only takes a tiny tiny amount to cleanse your face with this. It really goes a long ways and makes my face feel smooth and clean. It strips off oil and dead skin cells nicely and leaves a healthy more youthful look. I use the toner after, but sometimes I don't and am fine without it.",5.0
