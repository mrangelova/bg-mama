"Estee Lauder's Beautiful is a truly fabulous perfume and putting it into a rollerball applicator was brilliant. Perfect size for carry-on luggage and fits into a purse easily. I dislike spraying on perfume, it seems a gross way to apply scent. The rollerball makes it much easier to reapply later in the day. The only drawback would be that the rollerball does allow some contamination over time, but I find I am using my perfume more often now and using it up faster.",5.0
