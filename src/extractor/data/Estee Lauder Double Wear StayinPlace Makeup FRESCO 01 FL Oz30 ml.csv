"This makeup is 5 stars or more. Why? Because it does exactly what it says it is supposed to do. Not many things do that nowadays. You can depend on it. I put it to the test when I ride horses all day on a 105 degree day, or in  the mist and humidity, or even get splashed by the hose when I'm hosing my horse off, its still there, true to form. Its not oily and doesn't run or smudge or come off on my clothes unless you really, really rub pretty hard. Its still there when I finally wash it off with soap and water at the end of the day. Its other advantage is in making you look better than you did before applying it! For me, it can make me look like I've had 12 hours of sleep when I've had none because of worrying about the horse show the next day. Color has been consistent over the past 15 years, I have not changed that at all, and no problems with light or heavy areas.  The other important plus is in not having to use any powder and still not look shiny, a pet peeve, and yet not looking like you have a mask on or cakey or dry. If you truly want a base to stick around all day and look almost like you just put it on, this is it. I've used this base now for 15 years and learned my lesson early on by trying to cut corners and use something less pricey, don't do it, because the other plus is a 1 oz bottle lasts me for over a year, I've literally dated the bottle before to verify that. That is an excellent bang for your buck to me. Probably the only caution I would have is, it is quick to dry, so put it where you want it right away and smooth it in, applying in small little drops is best for me, starting with under the eyes first. It also does not settle or require any shaking other than a wave or two  just because. I've missed using it for 2 or more days and not had it settle. Pretty cool little bottle of instant improvement at a very reasonable price and very user friendly. Highly recommended.",5.0

"I have adult acne, most are along my jawline (hormonal). These blemishes never go away, so I have to cover them on a daily basis. I have been using this foundation for 3 years now. It covers the most awful blemishes, scars and redness. My skin looks flawless even when underneath it  are the red patches of skin, unevenness, pimples and huge pores. It gives your skin a nice healthy glow as well. I remember one day a lady approached me and complimented on my skin. I knew that she was not lying because my best friend, who is never shy to tell me that I look ugly or pretty, asked me if I have paid a fortune to a dermatologist to perform such a miracle on my misbehaving skin.",5.0

"I have only worn it once, but it was just as I expected!",5.0
"I buy this foundation bc it's the only one that will last on my oily skin. When I got this, it was very thick which usually it's pretty thin when you open a new bottle. It didn't lay on my skin the way it usually does and my face was an oil slick after 4 hours. I used my old bottle last night to see if maybe my skin was changing but it's not my face stayed out for 9+ hours while taking a masquerade mask on and off at a RAVE sweating my balls off. Did I mention I was a professional performer there on stage too? I would just order it from Macy's and wait the extra time for shipping. Trust me.",3.0
Excellent product.,5.0
Would never use anything else since I  tried this. Covers beautifully and truly DOES last all day!  I use the Cool Bone and it is a perfect match for my light porcelain complexion.  COVERS IMPERFECTIONS WELL!  LOVE this product.  Pricey but lasts me about a month.,5.0
The foundation was way to light. I expected the foudation color to be a little darker from what the picture looked like.,2.0
"I wanted to like this, I really, really did. (Considering what I paid? Yes, REALLY wanted to love it actually.)I ordered the lightest shade I could find as I'm pretty pale. It still took a tinge of an orange tint on my face. I had to rely on another layer of powder to lighten it more - yet still the orange.But I will say one thing, it does stay in place! The coverage is great! It's a very thick formula. WIth other brands, I can put it in my finger or on a sponge and wipe it on. That technique wouldn't work with this makeup. I needed to use a small brush and almost paint it on. A little goes a loooong way!Unfortunately I only got a few uses out of it before deciding it just wasn't for me. Expensive paperweight. :(",3.0
Lasts all day as long as you are not sweating.,4.0

"If you have oily skin and want full coverage, this is the one for you. I have always struggled with foundations not covering my redness and melting off my face after a few hours. That half on/half off melted look is definitely not cute. After watching hours worth of reviews on Youtube, I decided this was the one I wanted to try and that I was willing to shell out the money for it. I had a pretty good idea of the shade I thought I would be 1C1 Cool Bone from looking online, but thought I'd be smart and go in and get color matched. I went to a department store for that and ended up being sold 2C1 which was indeed wrong...too dark. I kept it for the when I'm more tan during and after a sunny vacation though. That's how much I love this stuff and am sure I'll still love it! I went with my instincts and ordered the 1C1...perfect match!Now, as to application. I use a Kabuki brush to apply. It is a very liquidy foundation. I know people complain that there is no pump. I've had no issues just pouring out a bit at a time on my hand. However, I know that you can purchase a MAC pump that fits if you feel the need. It does dry fairly quickly, so I do a section of my face at a time. I find it works best for me to stipple it on as opposed to swiping...gives the best coverage.If you're not used to full, truly matte coverage, you may be a bit shocked. It can feel a bit like a mask at first. I don't find it that way, but I don't want anybody to be overwhelmed. This is not going to be a no makeup, makeup look or feel. The super matte look definitely needs a bit of blush/bronzer to give your face some dimension again or you're going to look a bit flat. I don't mean to make this sound over complicated. It's really not!I've used the DW with and without a setting powder. Honestly, it stays either way. I am just so used to it I feel a little strange without a dusting of it on so I throw on a light dusting of my Ben Nye Translucent Set.I just want to reiterate that if you have very oily/acne prone skin...give this a shot ladies! It has really helped me. I thought I was doomed to 3 hour makeup...I was wrong!",5.0
"I was hesitant about this product because of the price, but as the famous saying goes- 'Buy cheap buy twice' - Well, I must've paid five times over. I was continuously on the hunt for the perfect foundation. One that didn't look greasy, slide off my face in two hours or settle into fine lines looking like a three dimensional, clay map.This stuff is amazing. It gives you supreme coverage. It stays put and gives you a beautiful matte finish for hours on end.Though it's expensive, you only need to use a tiny bit. It tends to dry quickly so you need to work fast. I would recommend light dabs with a makeup brush and then promptly blend with a makeup blending sponge (egg shaped)The hunt is over! Double Wear is the best foundation I've ever used, and I've tried them all! Now all I have to do is figure out what to do with the eight bottles of other stuff I have under my bathroom sink. One last note- matching a color online can be tough. I googled the Este website and looked at all the shades, comparing the swatches to mine. Their chart online is spot on. I went with cool bone and nailed it on the first try.Good luck ladies! The shine is gone for good!",5.0
I love it! Thank you so much I recommend product!,5.0

"This make up was matched to me about four years ago,  after Chanel stopped making my color.I had taken for granted the incredible benefits.  The oil control is flawless,  The color matching is wonderful.  I have a summer shade and a winter shade.Recently I tried another premium line of make up which just started carrying my color. I had forgotten how much I needed that oil control. I will *never* stray from Estée Lauder double wear again.",5.0
"I have used this product for as long as I can remember.  I have really dark circles around my eyes, and this product is the only thing I've ever used that covers and stays on until I wash it off, whether it's 5pm or 1am.  It is a truly miraculous product!",5.0
"This is best foundation I have ever used. I have been faithfully using this product for over 7 years and it is amazing. The coverage is perfect and it lasts forever. It doesn't clog your pores, and it conceals very well. I work as a flight attendant and I can literally put this on at 2 am, have a 10 hour flight, arrive back home and have it still looking fresh. I would recommend this to everyone.",5.0
Best foundation I have ever used!  And I'm really picky when it comes to makeup. It's a little thick so when I apply it I make sure to wet my beauty blender well and when I apply the foundation I dab dab on the face. No smudges.. It last all day so it's absolutely my favorite!  I have really oily skin but this foundation really makes a big difference threw out the day.  Definitely going to keep buying this product!,5.0
"I had used this foundation in the past but wanted to try some different things so I quit using it. After a year, I'm glad to say that I'm returning to this product. It offers great coverage, it's a good match for my skin tone and once applied, it doesn't need setting powder or anything else. It's ready to go. It really does stay on ALL DAY, too. I will never stray again!",5.0
"Every woman’s dream is to have that perfect, flawless, natural-looking, and close to a baby-bum’s smooth skin. Truth be told, most would rather save their last dime and skip meals in order to achieve this very fantasy. The daily unavoidable life stressors, toxins from the sun and lack of nutrients, not forgetting age, however, robs us off this luxury. True beautiful confidence comes from feeling great inside and beaming out that very same energy outwards as well. There is nothing that can turn a girl’s almost perfect day into a nightmare, than the reality that they have been spotting two different skin shades of foundation. This can turn a romantic date into a disastrous event. There has been so much hype about this topic with countless companies working around the clock to satisfy the largest lucrative market out there - the woman’s skin.It is no secret therefore that the most frustrating and daunting task out there is to get a shade that fits exact as your second skin. We all struggle from time to find ‘that one’ the one that is going to make us believe it was designed perfectly for our skin. Determined to find one, I drove all the way to the mall of America on one beautiful Saturday afternoon.  Timidly I walked from one makeup counter to another, scared of looking like soot or a clown who is ready to perform. I realized a strong similarity in foundations all looking familiar after the third or fourth isle in the makeup department, the beige, brownish liquid fluid with pungent scent and sometime just blaah! Few of them smelling like engine oil dripping from a crude old van. My stomach by now was churning with anger, exhausted and almost throwing up the towel after 6th counter of ‘trial and error’. I have a really hard time finding something with enough pink undertones without making me look like I have calamine lotion smeared generously on my face. Filled with emotions of anxiety mixed with disappointment on this humid and torrid day, wondering in my head ‘how hard can it be to find a foundation?’ To my tremendous relief, though, as soon as I approached this charming, professional looking, dressed in navy blue color lady, her inviting and totally calming smile reassured me that I was about to kiss my foundation troubles goodbye and voom! Just like the magic wand, in a few seconds, a chart with in-depth skin tone color helped her recognize two liquid foundations to match my skin, one read 6C1 and the other one of shade 5C1(Rich Chestnut). She grabbed a sanitized gauze to cleanse the skin, next she scooped the foundation from a tight closed bottle, using a clean brush. She tried the most treasured wonder fluid on my face. By this point, my heart was racing with speed and so many thoughts rushing in my mind, praying this one works. The first one did not, it was of a much darker shade and uneven. My neck looked pale like paper in comparison to the made up face. The obvious attempt was to try the second sample , carefully, she unwound the bottle, shook it gently and applied it on my skin blending and brushing the consistency all over the face and in a much slower voice, she handed me a mirror probing me” what do you think of this one? The moment she swatched this on my skin I instantly fell in love with it, it was really love at first sight.  I love it! I yelled, Yaay!! Screaming with joy and jumping up and down from the makeup chair, I did a little victory dance, peeping closely to the biggest mirror close to my vicinity, at the same time holding the small mirror in my right hand. I smiled like a star on the darkest night admiring the reflection I saw on the other side. I saw absolutely flawless coverage and 100% matched skin color. She let me enjoy and savor the moment. From that moment, my friends, I got converted to the Double wear society; my pot of gold.  This product comes in an easy to apply quality - a 30 mL bottle with a wide range of tones to fit every skin. It has a mild pleasant aroma that is non-irritant to persons with allergies. Its smooth, even constituency enables usage to last drop therefore giving the user their money’s worth. The product finish leaves you with a flawless velvety dewy finish, its amazing feel to the skin. It is very lightweight to the face providing a glowing smooth skin. This makeup lasts long which is an additional advantage to those of us who have neither the time nor the inclination to be fiddling around with touch ups or re-applications in our busy lives. The price is reasonable, it lasts about two and half months. Application is effortless, you can either use your fingers to apply or a brush. Nothing compares to its velvety long lasting power and smooth finishing due to its pride in containing medical grade polymers which enables it to stay in the skin holding close tightly and preventing rubbing off on surfaces the skin gets into contacts with. Its competitor the Makeup forever foundation did not have this quality despite the promise that it does. Every time I hugged someone dressed in light colored clothes, the brown makeup was transferred and shed to them, it dripped on my papers while at work which was quite embarrassing. My ultimate overall favorite quality of the double wear makeup is, without a doubt, its clear and excellent photographing feature which prevents flashbacks. Most major successful modelling firms use it for their makeup before taking incredible outdoor and indoor photos. By purchasing this foundation, you will be confident of getting clearer memories captured in your cameras. In order to get a great value of your makeup, I advice starting with little and continue building on it where needed -Less is always more. You will enjoy a superb hydration loaded with an SPF of 10 preventing potential sun spots and sun damages which could lead to early wrinkles. It is a product one can use all year round. In winter months, most people suffer from dry skin and in the summer months, the skin turns oily and shiny. This foundation provides the balance that corrects this problem therefore giving you double benefits. Did I mention that you don’t necessary require a primer to prepare the skin? As compared to other products from Clinique, Lancôme and Makeup forever brands, my skin did not break out from irritation.One of the minor cons is, living in a smaller town, sometimes they run out of dark skin tones. To avoid disappointments, you should order in time, and avoid the mistake of ordering last minute. For best results I recommend consulting a professional to match it to your exact skin color.This is an amazing product that I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to simplify their life, with a quest to finding a fabulous, natural, great coverage coming with a range of colors for all complexions and user friendly making it usable all year round.",5.0
"The color was slightly lighter than I expected but turns out it works fine with a little bronzer added to the cheekbones, etc., and possibly I've been using a color that was too dark is this blends nicely with my complexion. Great coverage and I can add a little more to problem areas without it looking or feeling thick.",5.0
"I was impressed with the first use. The color was perfect and the finish was matte, just like I hoped. It has great coverage and no retouch is needed throughout the day. What amazed me most was that it does not transfer. Usually if I touch my face, it leaves finger marks on my skin and the foundation rubs off but this foundation does not budge! I just love everything about it!",5.0
"I have a nasty surgery scar from cancer smack dab in the center of my forehead. I was in an endless search to find something to cover the scar, at least a little.. NOTHING worked. Until I found double wear. This stuff is simply worth every penny! It mostly covers my scar, makes my skin look flawless, and I've gotten so many compliments on my complexion when wearing this stuff. I definitely will continue to buy this product and will continue to recommend it!",5.0
"I have always been a natural looking makeup woman. Fascinated with the entire collection of makeup, but also reluctant and timid. I would admire women with the entire hour long makeup application, but I personally felt that if I could see that I had makeup on, I was overdone. I asked several women what makeup they wore when their skin looked so flawless.It was always DoubleWear. Let me note that I work in an upscale department store, directly across from cosmetics. I avoided them like the plaque until I was curious about doublewear.I was given a sample and have been sold ever since. The look is so much more polished and professional than Charlotte tilbury or Guerlain meteorites.I spent so much more for so much less",5.0
Loved this foundation when I was younger (say 25 years ago) and decided to try it again. Now I hate it. It makes my skin look dry and shows up every little line. Not good for more mature skin. Will not buy it again; too expensive anyway. I have had better luck with over-the-counter products in drug stores.,2.0
"I read a lot of reviews about this product and I have seen mostly good reviews and they are true!  Yes this product is a little pricey but you get what you paid for, it goes on thick and you don't need to use a lot when applying it. It does have a little bit of a strange smell but it's not overwhelming and it lasts all day. Lastly you don't even feel like you have makeup on when wearing it.",5.0
This makeup is definitely worth the investment.  The coverage is medium as I wanted and it stays on all day as promised.  You can go to Estée Lauder's website to help pick the right color you need.,5.0

"Ugh so sad this didn’t work for me! After reading reviews I thought for sure this was meant to be but NOPE! I’m 36 combo skin, still break out occasionally, pale/light tone and have freckles. It covers like a light to maybe a medium coverage foundation. Didn’t cover well, and although I got the lightest shade with cool undertone it looked too dark and yellow. Didn’t wear well, breakthrough oil very quickly even with different primers. Missed my window for return 🙁",2.0
"I absolutely love this fpundation! I use a very small amount and mix it with a small amount of moisturizer and apply it with a beauty blender. A little goes a long way and it lasts a long time. I powder over it with a little bit of translucent baby powder because my skin is sensitive and fair and it makes my skin very soft. I got this way back at the beginning of September, and right now it is march 13th and I still have another months worth left in the bottle. Definitely worth the price as long as you use it wisely and take care of it! Love this product!",5.0
"I love this foundation. I like a nice full coverage, and I want a foundation with coverage that lasts an entire day. I want makeup that survives a full day at work, an entire workout at the gym,...that sort of thing. This is the best foundation I have ever used! Great coverage, stays put, and I just LOVE IT. For those looking for that ""natural beauty"" look, look elsewhere. This is best for those who like full coverage and don't mind looking ""done."" This foundation is best applied with Beauty Blender.",5.0
"I'm not much of a makeup person, but as I've gotten older, my skin needs a little help.  I found this after learning about ways to cover my increasingly reddish skin.  I love that it's buildable--you can start with a small amount and add as needed for full coverage.  I haven't had any issues with breakouts or clogged pores and my skin looks natural.  I apply with a foundation brush so I don't tug on my skin which makes it redder.  This stuff holds all day (I use Clinique Super City Block 40 as a primer/sunscreen which really helps keep my foundation in place all day).  Worth the $.",5.0
"Perfect color match, and a great price. My favorite makeup blogger recommended this brand and I understand why. Feels great, and stays put all day in Arizona heat.",5.0
This product is a fake. The bottle says made in Canada and original Estee Lauder will say made in Belgium. It reaked of chemicals when I opened it. Please don't submit your skin to this garbage! I started the return before even pitting it in my skin... plus it costs $5 more than the original!!,1.0
"This foundation has always been a favorite of mine. It comes in so many undertones and shades that even the hardest complexion to match will be able to find a shade that works! To me, it leaves a nice matte finish which I like since I can be oily, especially in my T Zone. It lasts all day and doesn't get cakey.",5.0
"First of all, I know this is my color because I had gotten color-matched at Sephora and bought one there. As I was running out, I thought I’d give it a chance on amazon being that it’s about cheaper. I ordered it on a Sunday and received it on Wednesday (much faster than I anticipated) and it’s perfect. I was worried it wasn’t going to be brand new but it totally is. It’s the real deal and I’m so happy I gave it a shot! I use this foundation on all my bridal clients because the coverage is beautiful and photographs like a dream! Definitely recommend you get color matched before you buy online though!",5.0

"Whenever I want to invest my time in a full face of makeup I go for this product as my foundation. I thought I had overpaid when I first bought this because usually I don't invest in a foundation that is more than $10. However, this really proved it was worth it when I had to run back and forth for an event I was doing at work. I even had to do an on camera interview and worried my face was going to look like an oily and shiny mess but nope! I was surprised when the makeup hadn't budged and there was no shiny face. So I basically use this whenever I want to put my time into quality long lasting makeup instead of my usual ""natural"" routine.",5.0
"Second time purchasing, great for overall coverage, just be sure to use a blending sponge and apply in well lit light so you don't miss any areas. Love how long the application lasts.",5.0
I love this double wear make-up. It stays on and covers very well!!! I like the yellow tone in this shade; it work well with my light skin and gives me a healthy look.,5.0
"I always wear makeup even when I'm playing volleyball so I decided hey why not go to my nearest sephora and test it out before a match. After the match my face was matte. I do have oily skin  but this foundation holds up well. They don't have a  huge variety of colors when it comes to foundation but It's definelty better than MAC. I love MAC but when you're a teenager with problematic skin, MAC isn't for you. I was reluctant when my dermatologist told me to switch makeup brands but I had to. When I started using double wear my pimples started disappearing. I still have a few scars to fix but this stuff is great if you have problematic skin.Cons:1. takes time  apply evenly (consider using a synthetic foundation brush or a dab with a sponge, or use fingers2. if you have uneven skin tone everywhere you have to blend it into your neck and your ears.3. if you have oily skin and  the foundation is lighter than your skin and you accidentally swipe some off  you'll notice, invest in some translucent powder, makes a huge difference",5.0
"I'd been a Clinique user for life but recently my shade started to look orange against my very pale skin and they do not have anything lighter. In addition to my need for near-white foundation, I also needed something that was oil free so my pores wouldn't clog and full coverage to cover hyperpigmentation from acne. I tried to find this combination on my own by scouring the internet and failed. When I went into my local department store I was afraid I had a case so full of specific needs that I would come out empty handed. The worker suggested Este Lauder Double Wear in Bone and I am so thrilled! It is the perfect color match, it's layerable so I can use it to cover any red spots without looking overdone, and I haven't experienced an increase in acne. It feels natural on my skin, doesn't rub off, and doesn't have a paint/chemical smell like a lot of similar foundations. The only issue I have is that it occasionally sinks into the pores on my chin (which are not particularly large). My face looks dewy and flawless. I would recommend this product 120%!",5.0
This product is amazing! I truly love this foundation I have had mild acne all my life and I have tried several foundations that to find one that doesn't break my face out but also covers all my blemishes. This product will do just that it doesn't break my face out and it covers everything really well. But I'd have to say the thing I'm most impressed with is that it lasts all day I work at a factory and this foundation will last all day at work without me having to put any powder on or anything. If you're looking for a good product I definitely recommend this one it may be pricey but it will last a long time and it has great quality!,5.0
"This is literally my holy grail when it comes to foundation. It doesn't crease or separate on my face and in my fine lines. It's beautiful and has a great texture.

"I bought this foundation expecting a flawless finish because Ive tried other estee lauder skincare products and they have been amazing. I have to say that when you just applied it gives a nice finish, matte and powdery look as If you didnt need to set it. For my combo skin it lasted a couple of hours looking matte on my t zone, after that I would be very oily. The lightest shade was a little dark for me and it oxidized to an even darker shade as The day went on. Keep in mind that its oil free, but it is not for oily skin or combo, so it will not control Your natural oils, it Will just not add extra oil to Your skin. Normal skin ladies will love this",3.0
"Great foundation, really does stay on well! Went for a facial & makeup application & was very pleased with the service/products.  It goes on smooth, covers well with even texture...no blotches. One of best products I have used, but is expensive compared to other high end brands (MaryKay, Clinique,etc.) I did receive several trial samples of products with my purchase of products, but would rather have received discount on purchase, instead. Would like to continue using it, but in today's economy I'm not sure if the value is worthy of the cost. Estée Lauder is one the oldest cosmetic companies still in business & should be able to give the consumer a reduction in cost.",4.0
Very difficult to rub into the skin smoothly. It sits on top of the skin and doesn't blend well. Disappointing from a luxury brand.,2.0
I have really bad sun marks and this didn't cover it. If your skin is not patchy you may live it.  But for patty dark spots I would not recommend.,3.0
This is my absolute favorite foundation and I have never tried any that has even compared to this. The coverage is awesome (I've got a few old acne scars) it also hides blemishes and diminishes the under eye circles. The greatest thing is I never ever break out from this and it stays all day! This is the only foundation that has ever showed up on a washcloth or cotton pad while cleaning my face at the end of the day. The finish is a perfect matte so powder usually isn't necessary unless it's a really humid day I may put a little powder in the T-zone of my face. I have never purchased this from Amazon before as I usually purchase from a department store during the promotional periods ( i.e. You get free bag with some products when you spend a certain amount) but I just wanted to share my opinion with everyone since I love this so much and highly recommend it!,5.0
Absolutely love this foundation!  I have been a avid user of another high end makeup brand( not naming names) for 10 years but noticed my sensitive skin stayed with break outs daily. As I am caramel complexion and very hyperpigmented I am picky about full coverage.  I stepped out of box and tryed this an so glad I did! This has so much coverage while only having to use a little.  And it feels like a second skin no caking. I haven't broke out since I found this!! The bottle doesn't pump and it's made of glass would be things to beware of. My new fav.,5.0

"If you have oily skin and want full coverage, this is the one for you. I have always struggled with foundations not covering my redness and melting off my face after a few hours. That half on/half off melted look is definitely not cute. After watching hours worth of reviews on Youtube, I decided this was the one I wanted to try and that I was willing to shell out the money for it. I had a pretty good idea of the shade I thought I would be 1C1 Cool Bone from looking online, but thought I'd be smart and go in and get color matched. I went to a department store for that and ended up being sold 2C1 which was indeed wrong...too dark. I kept it for the when I'm more tan during and after a sunny vacation though. That's how much I love this stuff and am sure I'll still love it! I went with my instincts and ordered the 1C1...perfect match!Now, as to application. I use a Kabuki brush to apply. It is a very liquidy foundation. I know people complain that there is no pump. I've had no issues just pouring out a bit at a time on my hand. However, I know that you can purchase a MAC pump that fits if you feel the need. It does dry fairly quickly, so I do a section of my face at a time. I find it works best for me to stipple it on as opposed to swiping...gives the best coverage.If you're not used to full, truly matte coverage, you may be a bit shocked. It can feel a bit like a mask at first. I don't find it that way, but I don't want anybody to be overwhelmed. This is not going to be a no makeup, makeup look or feel. The super matte look definitely needs a bit of blush/bronzer to give your face some dimension again or you're going to look a bit flat. I don't mean to make this sound over complicated. It's really not!I've used the DW with and without a setting powder. Honestly, it stays either way. I am just so used to it I feel a little strange without a dusting of it on so I throw on a light dusting of my Ben Nye Translucent Set.I just want to reiterate that if you have very oily/acne prone skin...give this a shot ladies! It has really helped me. I thought I was doomed to 3 hour makeup...I was wrong!",5.0
"Love this foundation! Only thing I will use now! It covers everything, gives a nice glow, blends nicely with concealer, stays on all day, & smells nice! Only thing I'd warn people about is how oily/thick it feels. You have to stay up on washing your face every night otherwise it will cause acne!",5.0
I thought this would be the foundation for me considering all of the incredible reviews but when I got it I noticed that it made my pores look even larger and instead of covering acne it made it look more noticeable and dry compared to when I use other foundations.,1.0

"I came across this makeup through watching a few videos on youtube.  All the videos and reviews on this foundation have been really high, and everyone says it really does stay in place all day and night, and won't transfer.  I was desperate for a foundation that would not rub off on everything.  I got matched at Estee Lauder at Macy's, and was given a free 10-day supply of 2 similar shades.  I like 5N2 Amber Honey better for me (I couldn't figure out how to change the color selection when writing this review).  This foundation is absolutely amazing!!  Now I see why everyone is so giddy over this stuff.  It gives a nice, smooth, matte finish.  I don't even have to powder my entire face with this foundation.  I just dust a little powder on my nose and forehead.  I usually put my makeup on at about 7:30 am. When I get ready for bed, the makeup looks like I just put it on, no exaggeration. It really does stay in place too.  No more smudges of makeup on my collars and scarves.  And no more of me getting makeup on all of my papers at work (I have a bad habit of touching my face).  I switched from Mac to L'Oreal, and decided that it was not necessary to spend so much money on high end makeup.  But now that I have discovered Estee Lauder, I'm done with drugstore foundation.  I can't wait to try the double wear light, but if it doesn't work for me, that's fine because the original double wear is truly a Godsend!  The first couple of days, I applied it with my brush and it looked great. But I noticed a cleaner look with a beauty blender.  Whichever you use, I would recommend a stippling technique to apply this, rather than buffing it in with a circular motion.  A few reviewers have said this did not work for their dry skin.  If you have dry skin, I would try the double wear light, which is more of a natural finish, rather than matte. The Amazon price is a little higher than the department store prices, as are most high-end makeup products.  It is also cheaper buying directly from esteelauder.com.",5.0
"This review is for all shades of Double Wear. This is probably the best full coverage foundation on the market - Kat Von D is much thicker, harder to blend and has the tendency for a powdery, cakey finish if you're not careful. Marc Jacobs re(Marc)able is a mess- the shades are all very warm and yellow toned and separate on the face. Estée is $38 in stores.",5.0
"I buy my foundation at Macy's not online, so just wanted to say I been using this foundation for 5 years the best ever, blends so well, light, flawless, and the nice thing is that it does not oxidize. I tried everything on the market and nothing has come close to this. Just hope in years to come when I reach my late 30's it will still have the same beautiful effect.",5.0
Amazing foundation for the price. I never have to reapply and stays flawless. Very easy to apply with a Beauty Blender or alike.

"This is the Absolute BEST foundation I have ever used and I've tried so many...from high end brands to cheaper brands. I do strongly recommend that you get this product from a department store instead of here so that you know you are getting the real deal.  A lot of times, in the department stores like Belks or Dilliards, they will run a gift with purchase and include all kinds of goodies (like mascaras, lip glosses, night creams, etc).Now, for the review. I have combination skin (and Fresco is the color I use) that tends to get dry and the winter and a bit oilier in the summer. This foundation literally works all year around for me. It's so much easier to blend than the others' I have tried and it lasts and lasts. I have the Estee Lauder foundation brush for blending but I tired of that quickly (it doesn't blend well for me) and just started using the white wedge sponges that I get from the drugstore). I normally just wear some bronzer (drugstore brand-Physicians Formula) on top of it and I might dab just a little baby powder on my forehead, nose, and chin. That's literally all you need. It will look just as beautiful 12 hours after applying it. I have worked out and this is still on after my work out. Another great thing? It doesn't smear on clothes! I love that about this foundation. Now, it will take a little more than just a single face wash to get it off. I will usually just wash my face twice using a wash cloth. That normally does the trick. I get so many compliments on my complexion when I wear it.",5.0
I just switched from Bare Minerals to Estee Lauder Double Wear (Dawn)! I have to say I LOVE this foundation!!!! The coverage is AMAZING and it looks so flawless on this skin!

This foundation I very drying even for combination oily skin. The coverage is great but It's so easy to cake face of you aren't taking special care. I recommend a wet makeup sponge to apply rather than a brush. A white cast is also very noticeable during flash photography which isn't great.

"This is my every day makeup especially in the winter, I may use a lighter Clinique in the summer because I don't need as much coverage but I love this makeup. A little & I mean a little bit goes a long way. What I like about it the most is the full coverage. This makeup is very buildable and does not come off on clothes. I moisturize very well prior let it sit on my face for about 10 minutes then apply this foundation. I do not use my fingers or a sponge I use a brush. After I get the initial application on then I take the sponge and push it lightly into my skin. This coverage stays on all day with no touch ups. The downside is where it is such a full coverage it takes a good makeup remover to take off. The colors look natural to your skin and I feel as though it is full coverage and stay in place that my skin does still so to speak breath, & because I have no sign breakouts! :)",5.0
"I so wanted to love this foundation, and was hopeful after the rave reviews.  I'm pretty pale, neutral, but their lightest tones were still a bit too dark.  I could make it work, though.  I'm giving it 1 star, because it does have staying power.. Almost to a fault ! Unfortunately, this foundation destroyed my skin, causing a surface burn, scaley skin (imagine post-sunburn, after the skin peels).  I also broke out worse than teenaged years.  It's been 3 days since I've had it on (I only wore it twice), and my skin is still bright red burned/scaley.  I've never had that happen before, and I do have sensitive skin.
