"We received a conterfeit product from seller 'Velvet Viper.'  The bottle and lid is made of a cheaper material and the text is in a larger font compared to the actual product.  When you open it, the smell is different and the liquid is sticky.  Amazon was very helpful in filing a claim to get my money back.I've attached a few picture to give you examples of what to look for.  In each picture, the real product is on the left and the counterfeit is on the right.Picture 1: Look at the text.  The printing is thinner and cleaner on the legit product.  The font is larger and not as sharp on the counterfeit.Picture 2: The plastic bottle has distinct seams where no such seams exist on the legit product.Picture 3: The bottom of the counterfeit bottle doesn't have the plastic logo, instead it just has a circle.Picture 4: Another example of the poor printing on the fake bottle.  Compare the logo at the very bottom.  While you can clearly read ""24M"" on the legit version, the printing all runs together on the counterfeit bottle and just looks like a smudge.",1.0

I have been using ANR for 5+years and adore the product!!! It gives amazing results!! I have not been pleased with The last 2 bottles purchased from Amazon!! My face feels completely different !!!

"I have been purchasing this product for the past 8 years.  I love it and the product does wonder for my skin.However, please note that THIS PRODUCT IS 100% FAKE from this seller.  I am sure of it.  I do not know why Amazon has not yet put a stop to the sale of this product as I am not the first one to notice.Some people have written in their reviews very detailed descriptions as to why this product is fake.  For me, it is simple.Why do I know this is fake?1. It is watery and not more gooey (for lack of a better term) than the real product.  When I put it on my face, this product from this seller runs down my face like water.Maybe it is watered down but worst case scenario, it is imported from another country and you have no idea what you are putting on your skin.DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE PRICE!  I have purchased this product from this seller twice already so I know it is not just that something has gone wrong in shipping or it is a one off thing.In fact, I cannot reliably find ANY real ""Estee Lauder - Advanced Night Repair Serum"" on Amazon at all.My advice is: Rather than waste $65 or $81 (which was another serum I was planning to buy on Amazon because the price range is close to the real price for this product), please just spend the extra money and buy from Sephora (also free shipping since it is $95 on the site) because at least you know you are getting the real thing.",1.0
"This is NOT really Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair. Do not order this product! As someone who uses ANR regularly I thought I would give Amazon a try and order it online. I quickly was able to tell that the product delivered is a fake/knock off product. The packaging is an impressive copy cat however the bottle I received is not glass like the real product would be and the dropper inside is crooked and made from a different material than the real one. The real product would be a thicker, golden tinted liquid that has a distinct but pleasant smell. When I opened the bottle I ordered I found a runny, slimy, pinkish colored liquid with a soapy consistency when rubbed in. The product never absorbs into the skin. Who knows what is actually in the bottle I received, I fear for people who do not know what this product should be like and apply this to their face. It could be dangerous! I hope the seller of these fake products is removed from the Amazon marketplace because the false advertising and knock-off products are taking advantage of so many loyal, Amazon customers.",1.0
"I have been an Estee Lauder user for years.  I used to sell the product in a well known department store years ago.  Having been a long time user I can attest to the fact that whatever is in the bottle is NOT ANR.  It looks like it, almost feels like it but when you apply it to your face you know it is not the right gel.  What used to take 6-7 drops to cover my face and neck now takes 3-4 drops and it is a bit slicker.  I had no adverse reactions to it, thank goodness, but I stopped using it after 3 days once I realized I had been given a false product.  Shame on me for trying to save some money and expect to get what was advertised.  Do not waist your money on this and go to a reputable EL counter for your next bottle.",1.0
it is absolutely fake product!! even one star is too much for them. people need to consider why this product is so cheap compared with market price. because it is not authentic!!!,1.0
"I'm sorry to say that this highly-touted, award-winning serum failed to impress me.  Sorry because we all like to believe in a miracle cure, and sorry because I wasted a fair amount of cash.  I started using this product at night, topping it with a night cream as per recommendation on the box.  Because, by its nature, a serum is a carrier (i.e. it prepares the skin for the active cream that follows) it is difficult to evaluate its effectiveness in isolation.  The only way is to compare results between the combo of the serum plus cream, versus the cream alone.Since I had not noticed any quantifiable results after two months of regular use, I carried out an experiment: I applied serum plus cream to one side of my face, and cream alone to the other.  After two weeks of nightly use and comparisons, I could not see any difference between the two (which suggests to me that the serum was not doing much).  I continued to use up the bottle (as it had been such an expensive purchase) but, sadly, my skin did not respond any better.  I have since had the opportunity to try other, less expensive serums which have given me much better results.  It may well work for other people, but when a product makes such extravagant claims, I expect to see at least a moderate improvement.  The only plus is that the 30 ml bottle lasts a long time.UPDATE:  I keep getting asked if I bought the Complex II, and the answer is NO.  At time of purchase, the product offered was the original Complex.  The product page has been updated but many reviews were written about the previous, original product.  Also, the selling price is now half of what I paid which makes a bit of difference to the overall satisfaction rating.",2.0
