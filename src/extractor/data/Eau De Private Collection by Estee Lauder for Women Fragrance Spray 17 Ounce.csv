This is not the genuine Estée Lauder Private Collection perfume. Not even close. This thing is nauseating...,1.0
I am giving this a 1 star because it is NOT the real deal. The fragrance is not the one I have used for 40 plus years. It is not a bad scent and I rather like it. Unfortunately like most cheaper cologne it does not last very long,1.0
It smells great! I used to wear this scent about 15 years ago and decided to try it again. This smells exactly like what I found in a department store a few days ago but it is $10 cheaper.,5.0
NOT THE SAME SMELL I HAD SMELLED BEFORE,2.0

"Since this is a discontinued fragrance of Estee Lauder, and because I loved this fragrance so much and still want to use it, I ordered it here.  Unfortunately, the fragrance is no longer as potent as when it is still being manufactured.  The scent is still the same, but it fades after an hour, unlike when it was still being sold in department stores--it held its fragrance for practically all day long.",3.0

Smells strongly of alcohol and doesn't last nearly as long as buying it at a department store perfume counter.Was very disappointed.,2.0
"Wore this fragrance in the seventies.  It's hard to find now.  Found it on  Amazon and when I smelled it again, it took me back to my youth.  Liked it then, still like it.  Thanks, Amazon, for the endless variety of merchandise!",5.0
This did not work for me. I am too sensitive to the smell. But the company was awesome and took great care of me.,5.0
"I order this for my mother ever year, it's her fav, and she cannot seem to find it through the normal Macy's stores, back east. I adore having this sent to her as a surprise no matter where she is, it makes her so very happy, and that, is the best thing a daughter could do!!!",5.0
This product was HORRIBLE!!!  This was NOT the product that was described...it was not the product that I have used solely.  I use no other fragrance.  I have used this product for 14 years PLUS.  It has been the only fragrance that I have used due to allergy control and the scent does not interfere with my respiratory system.  Unfortunately I took it on vacation without sampling it.  The odor was absolutely HORRID.  Please in consideration of future buyers do not misrepresent it.  I thought I had saved time in purchasing from Amazon rather than a trip to store....that will NEVER happen again.  Buyer BEWARE.  I am out the money and incurred medical fees to clear up a bronchial condition caused by the fumes.  Mary P.,1.0

"Of all the different fragrances I have purchased for my wife over the years this is by far her favorite. Fragrances are a peculiar item. People want what they think smells nice but aren't necessarily concerned about how others respond to the scent, yet the main reason for wearing it is to impress others by your scent. Go figure. But having said that, she loves it and I know it is always a hit as a gift.",5.0

"The item I received is a bad imitation at best.It is NOT the ""real"" Estee Lauder Private Collection and I will not purchase from this site in the future.",1.0
"When I was younger I loved, loved, loved this perfume.  Once I got it home, I realized I didn't care for it as much as I remembered, so I gave it as a gift to my sister.",4.0
"I thought I was going to love this Private collection but oh my goodnessit is just too strong. A fragrance shouldn't enter the room 10 minutes beforeYOU do, and that's why I wouldn't purchase it again. Estee Lauder's""Sensuous"" is by far the most luxurious and gorgeous fragrance. Peoplehave stopped me at the gym to ask what fragrance I was wearing.....that'show delicate and lovely it is.",2.0
"Private Collection was my signature scent throughout the 1980s.  I got away from scent, if one may say it this way, for about twenty-five years, but recently, I have experienced a Renaissance in my love for scent, and one of the first I ordered from Amazon Prime was Private Collection.Private Collection is one of the most delicious, enticing, voluptuous, sexy, and strong (think character not smell) scents that I have ever smelt.  Unfortunately, the bottle I ordered was not delivered on time, and due to a holiday weekend, it sat for nearly an extra week inside a UPS truck in blisteringly hot and humid weather.  Heat, light, and humidity are scents' worst enemies, and my bottle of Private Collection and Miss Dior suffered accordingly.  I blame UPS for this, not Amazon.  However, there was enough sillage left over in my bottle to recall to me this wonderful, wonderful, wonderful scent, and I will not shy away from ordering it again!  I cannot wear most Estee Lauder scents (they literally make me ill), but this is definitely the exception!  Wearing it to bed tonight and am sure to have very sweet dreams indeed!",5.0
"This is NOT Eau De Private Collection by Estee Lauder! It is a fake or it is expired. The smell was horrible and I threw it out and, at least with fragrances, will never purchase another bottle of perfume through Amazon again! I went directly to a department store and purchased a proper bottle. Lesson learned.",1.0
The scent was very light.  not what I have had in the past.  Not sure what happened but the scent fades in a short time.  It used to last all day and take one spritz.  Now I use 7 or 8 spritzes from this bottle. Will go back to purchasing my scent from department stores again.,5.0
I love this fragrance but this bottle of fragrance is not fresh.  it smells like it has been sitting on the shelf way to long.  like a cheap knock off or past expiration date.  I'm very disappointed as I had not treated myself to a bottle for a while and was so looking forward to enjoying the scent again..,1.0
"I purchased this for mother's day for my mom who has been wearing Private Collection for over 50 years - and she said this is NOT the same perfume she buys and loves.  Her friends, my dad, everyone that knows and LOVES this perfume when she wears it, knew this was different.  It may have been a bad batch or maybe old - sitting on the shelves? I don't like negative reviews so will give them the benefit of the doubt that something in this batch went awry but use caution when spending this amount of perfume. Sadly disappointed in the purchase.",1.0
"I have been wearing Private Collection for about 30 years! It's an unusual scent & not the same flowery, sickenly sweet fragrance like most other women's perfumes. I get complimented on it everywhere I go. The history of this perfume is pretty interesting. Estee Lauder developed this fragrance for her own personal use...hence the name Private Collection. It was not marketed till 1973. This perfume is a very classic & elegant scent. I have tried others over the years but there's nothing quite like it. If Estee ever discontinues it, I'll be devastated. I'd better buy more & stock up!",5.0
The Box is worn out bad and the bottle does not look new and I am not sure if the bottleis 100% full as it shows a decrease in the content. Not like the one shown in photo.,2.0

"This is a scent I first tried many years ago.  After reading customer reviews I was a little hesitant to order it because of a few bad comments about the smell.  I am so glad that did not stop me.  The perfune is absolutely wonderful!  It is very strong when you first spray it on, and then after it ""settles"" it is just lovely.  It lasts a long time, and only takes a small spray for all day.  This will always be one I keep on hand from now on.",5.0
"My Mother has worn Private Collection since I was a girl.  They have new version out but we always want the ""old fashioned - tried and true version.""  This is a great price - fast shipping and she was delighted to get it for Christmas.",5.0

"First, the shipping date was pushed back so it arrived more than a week late.And, for some reason, there is no smell to the perfume (which I have worn for more than 25 years).Not when the bottle is open, not on my wrist, it is basically ""dead.""",1.0
