I can not say enough about this perfume!  The best Birthday Gift!  If you love florals with an all day linger....this IS the perfume!,5.0
"I always get complements when I wear this perfume. People tell me I smell like I just got out of a bath with flowers. It smells great to almost everyone because it is very reminiscent of a Jasmine tree in full bloom. Who doesn't love that!? When you sweat, it just releases that scent more strongly. A small bottle will last you quite a while, but the bigger bottle will last you at least 8-12 months. It's honestly worth every penny. If you like a more citrus-y scent though, try Pleasures Exotic.",5.0
"My only fragrance. I get so, so, so many compliments.  One friend was sniffing all the flowers to see which one smelled so good.  It was me!  And this is about twenty dollars cheaper than the department stores.",5.0
"Things are good, I'm very good, I'm satisfied, I'll buy again next time",5.0
"This version of Pleasures has a deeper, or as its name says, a more Intense floral aroma than the original version of Pleasures. By ordering it from Amazon, I got my favorite perfume for way less than if I'd bought from a department store. The larger bottle lasts me about a year and a half with daily application. Will order again when the time comes.",5.0
Arrived on time and in perfect condition. Always a consistent fragrance which my wife loves.,5.0

"I first picked this fragrance up when I was 16 and loved it immediately. My family bought me a small bottle for Christmas that year. It lasts a long time, the fragrance is very floral but also incredibly unique. Ten years later wanting perfume I ordered this and a few others but this is still my favorite it seems! I hope they never stop making this scent.",5.0

"Yuck.  I trusted the reviews without smelling.  Not sure if this what it's supposed to smell like, or it's a knock off, but it's gross.  Makes me gag just smelling it.  I feel like I walked into a funeral parlor.  Just a weird smell.  Maybe just too floral for me.",1.0

"I love this fragrance.  Flowery and welcoming scent.  In the market the other day a young man came up to me (i am71 !!!) and asked me if I was wearing Pleasures Intense.  I was so surprised.  He said that was his fiancee's scent and he loved it.  I was nonplussed at first, and then a little surprised that he would even approach me.  He said it made him happy.  What more can you ask from a perfume.  Flattered, pleased and a little nervous. But, he wassuch a sweet young man.  This is my favorite all time favorite ands wasso glad to make a memory for him too.",5.0

"I accidentally purchased this item thinking it was the Pleasures Delight. Unfortunately,(should have read the rules first) perfume cannot be returned and this scent is horrendous! It smells awful but they picked an addiquete name'Intense'.  I learned a valuable lesson never purchase perfume on Amazon!",1.0
"Wrong ""Pleasures."" Didn't want ""Intense."" Tried to stop the order twice, but on the second try the sender claimed it was ""too late."" Of course. I guess I'll go back to Macy's where I can see what I'm getting before it's wrapped.",1.0

"I love Pleasures scent, especially the Intense, but this bottle was very short on scent--diluted maybe??  Been using it for years, but my guess is it's a bootlegged fake.  Not pleased this time.  Scent is very similar, but definitely only last 3 minutes--not normal!!",2.0
I just love this perfume!  I had it about 15 years ago when it first came out (got it as a gift)but had to get this for myself this time.  It last a long time..I can smell lilacs in it..it is so light and fresh smelling.  I have a ton of really good perfume but this is one of my favorites.  I think it could become my signature perfume.  You will get compliments on this!!,5.0
"This was a Christmas present and a disappointment. This is also going to be the last time I buy a fragrance on Amazon, next time I will just go to Nordstrom. The smell was off and there were little floating particles in the perfume. I would not recommend. Amazon is great for so many things, fragrance is not one of them...",1.0
It's not the same as the Pleasures Intense that Macy's carries.  Absolutely Not. Hardly any smell. Seems to be mostly alcohol.NOT RETURNABLE,2.0
The fragrance does not last very long after using it. I had this before and it was much different.,2.0
"I had read another review stating their perfume came with dust like particles floating in it and it smelled a little off but I was hoping they maybe bought it from a third party so I made sure to choose Estee Lauder as the vendor. My bottle also came with the same dust like particles and doesn't smell right to me. I have worn this perfume previously and am so disappointed. And because it is a beauty item, it is not returnable. Pay the extra money and get it from the department store.",1.0
Love this perfume.  I finally have estee lauder pleasures and it smells amazing.  Its strong and stays on all day.  Always get compliments on it. Highly recommended,5.0
