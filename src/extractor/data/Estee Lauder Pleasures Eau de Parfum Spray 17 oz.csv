"I have been using Estee Lauder's Pleasures for more than a decade. I know exactly how it smells and i also know how long it can last on me (like forever). Although this product smells like the real one, however it hardly lasted on me. Barely an hour and it fades away. My hubby has bought this same perfume for me and my mom like maybe 7 years ago from Singapore Airport and my mom still has it. I use it sometimes when i go over to her place and it smells the same and it lasts for at least 6 hours. I bought this product from Amazon because the seller was Amazon and i have full trust in them. But i think either this stuff is fake or has storage issues. Like i said even a 7 year old bottle can still smell the same and is able to last for a long time. I am so disappointed in Amazon. Never will i buy fragrance from Amazon even if they are the sellers.",1.0
"This was a gift to a friend of mine. She said she loves the scent and this is one of her favorites. Also, the price was right because some places it was at a higher price.",5.0

I'm an Estee Lauder fan. I love florals and this fragrance is soft and light. I wear it daily no matter what the occasion.,5.0
"I love everything about it: the fragrance, the size of the bottle and the price. Actually, I thought the bottle was going to be much smaller, and so I was positively surprised when I received the package. Definitely a good deal for the money.As for the fragrance: I don't like it when a parfum is too heavily scented or too sweet. This one is flowery and light - perfect for spring.",5.0
"This is a gift, so I cannot comment on the product itself, per se. However, based on some reviews I was worried about getting a good deal for the ""real deal."" This definitely is the Eau de Parfum and is quality sealed, shipped directly from and sold by Amazon. My mother-in-law is going to love it.",5.0
just what I expected! No Surprises!,4.0
"I love the smell of the perfume on my wife. She said that people love her smell too. Actually, it's been her perfume for a long time , which she alternately uses with another perfume (NR's LduTemps). But she said she noticed that here in the U.S., LdT smells differently - somewhat stronger. Whereas with Pleasures, its the same in Manila & any other asian countries & the U.S. - flower based & sweet.",5.0

"I've owned this before now, and I loved it then, and I love it now. Great fragrance. The only complaint I have is that my husband bought this for me for mother's day with Prime, and it took almost two weeks for it to arrive. I think that is absolutely ridiculous. Why pay for prime when things won't arrive when you say it will?",5.0

Excellent,1.0
The product was diluted. This is not original. Bought it for my sister and the difference between what was bought at the mall is vast. This hardly lasts an hour no matter how much you spray on. The store bought product lasted the whole day with just a few drops.,1.0
"My wife has been using Pleasures for 10 years so when I noticed she was low I didn't hesitate to buy her another bottle.  Unfortunately, when this item arrived it did not smell like Pleasures.

Get it, and see for yourself :)",5.0

"I've used Pleasures by Estee Lauder for many years. It's a light floral scent, which is great for me because a lot of perfumes I find are too strong. When I wear it, I don't really notice it, but I continually have strangers who are walking behind me say, ""you smell good, what is that?"" Of course, we all know individuals' body chemistry plays a part in how we smell things and how things smell on us. But,it works for me!",5.0
