"I'm saddened that I haven't noticed any significant improvement and glad I only spend $ on this travel size. All my skin care is Estee Lauder so I figured this would be amazing but to be honest, after almost a month of using this nightly, I haven't noticed any difference in my skin. I'll keep using until I finish the bottle but so far I'm disappointed.",3.0
I haven't really noticed any difference but it's a small quantity.  smells good and feels good.  I know a lot of people rave about it so it's probably great over time.,3.0

I wanted to try a small sample because this was the complex II and was newer than the original.  It works wonders and helps with drying my blemishes.  I had tried many products to try and dry those milia and blemishes and the one I had that was most stubborn is gone.  I like to try the smaller sizes first in case they don't work because estee lauder is so expensive.  That is why I like to try amazon first and I can get lower prices here.,5.0
This serum is so nice! Id recommend buying the big bottle! It makes your skin feel so good and healthy plus your skin looks so glory afterwards. It's a great night serum! I love the way it came in fast and the bottle looks nice to! It feels so good on the skin and doesn't feel like it's irritating the skin or anything! I love it and will definetly repurchase soon! Can't get enough of it! Great for wrinkles and just for the overall texture of your skin plus it doesn't break me out which is a big deal in my skin care because I usually breakout pretty bad but my skin looks good! Everyone you need this in your skincare routine! Buy it:),5.0

"I normally buy the bigger size which is a much better value, but I needed this one for travel.  If you haven't tried yet, check with your local EL makeup counter, lots of times this is in their free gift with purchase.  As for the product, I love how this makes my skin look and feel.  I admit at first I wasn't convinced, but after I got on a routine of using nightly as directed it has really made a huge difference in my skin.  I feel like my skin looks younger and healthier.  I wear very little makeup now, nothing to hide!",5.0

"i've been using this and have not seen any changes , i do know it is not hurting my sensitive eye area , like other facial products have in the past , so thats good , i did call a specialist in this product , u can use a mask of some kind made of a kind of foil or a thin layer of a kind of gold , after putting this all over your face , or you can just use it by its self , i've not seen any changes yet , i'm 35 and i have wrinckles under my eyes from getting sunburned while squinting alot , and i am considering doing something exstreme to get rid of them , i think they age my face into my mid to late 40's , if and when i notice3 this product helping in any way , i will edit this .",3.0
"I received a sample of this awhile back and decided to look for it on Amazon.  I found this smaller bottle to try again which I decided to get before committing myself to the large more expensive bottle.  I really love it, I can see & feel the difference in my skin the next morning.  I just wish it wasn't so darn expensive.",5.0
"This seems to be a good product. It didn't break me out, which is a problem I usually face with many products. But I have used this only a short time. So have to wait and see about long term effects. However it is a little expensive. So I got only the travel size bottle. The only problem with the travel size bottle is that it doesn't have a filler type to get the product out.",3.0
Estée Lauder never lets me down and this product is no exception. I use it right before going to bed under my EL Resilience Night Deluxe. I feel it has made a difference in the way we skin looks.,5.0

"I bought this trial size of Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair to help me decide if I wanted to purchase the full size. I used this sample every evening for about a month. I did not notice a difference in my skin. At all. I generally make it a point to purchase makeup and skincare from large retailers where I can be certain of the origin. In this case, I did not want to shell out for the full size before trying it. Even though the sample did not change my skin, I made a leap of faith and ordered the full size from Sephora during the 20% off VIB sale. Within the first night, my skin was transformed. Redness was gone, my skin was silky. It keeps improving daily. A month of skincare is generally enough to determine (at least partial) effectiveness. Which makes me seriously consider that perhaps this was either not Advanced Night Repair or it was outdated. Whatever it is, it is not at all on par with the full size quality. I would suggest to purchase Advanced Night Repair from a retailer such as Sephora or anywhere that offers a good return policy in case your skin acts up. I recommend the product highly, but versions that are new and authentic!",1.0
"A good keyboard. The keys are a little smaller than most, but that actually helps your speed in typing. If you have large fingers, or aren't very adept with a Keyboard, this may not be the right one for you. Most of the Hot keys keys don't work, but I'm assuming that's because I'm on Win 7 Pro and the Hot keys are really made for Win 8.1. Plug and Play, On/Off switch to save batteries (Which come with it) The only thing is you have to keep a wipe nearby to keep up the Glossy look.",4.0
"EDIT: got to try a tiny packet of the anr from nordstrom just recently. The consistency of the sample was a lot more runny and also slightly pinkish in color. This bottle i got on Amazon had was yellowish and thick. Might have been an expired or fake prpduct afterall. I also noticed after i finished this tiny bottle that these tiny little raised bumps around my eye area disappeared. Probably had something to do with it since i didnt change my routine otherwise. I bought this item from a seller named ""drones"".Original review:Really appreciate being able to try this hugely popular item for a fraction of its usual price. I went to an Estee Lauder counter in Bloomingdales and they refused to provide any samples whatsoever of this...It's supposedly ""not for resale"" but stores now have a very similar version of this for $16 (they are the same size but the cap has a dropper included).As for the product itself - I think I noticed that some of my newer dark sun spots have faded and the pores around my nose in my T zone has gotten smaller. Hopefully it's not just wishful thinking.",5.0
