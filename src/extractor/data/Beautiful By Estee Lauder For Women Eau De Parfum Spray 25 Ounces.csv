"The perfume is great. The bottle though, was either stored in heat or other type environment where the plastic tube inside breaks off and half a bottle is left. Cannot use the remaining perfume. Too much waste. Local store would replace it if I brought it back. Over the last couple of years the online purchases fail and the store purchases have no problem, so far.",2.0
"I've worn this perfume for years and loved it.  This one doesn't smell the way I remembered it.  So I took it to my local store where I've purchased it before to see if I could figure out why.  The packaging was the same on both but the store clerk thought it might have gone bad because of the way it is stored.  I wanted to return it, but the system says it isn't available for return.  I would appreciate it if Amazon would put that in the description before I buy it and not after.  Thank you.",2.0

"I purchased two bottles of the 2.5fl oz perfume as a gift for someone. It arrived really really really well wrapped, which was excellent. I had to sign for it, which was excellent because I was home and I'd hate perfume to sit out in the sun deteriorating. Although, if i hadn't been home it would have been a nuisance not to have it just left on the doorstep.The big and not so great surprise is that the two boxes of perfume that arrived don't have a top to them. The pink box with Beautiful written on it looks perfect until you see that the top of the box is ripped off.The site says that it the perfume is un-boxed and I think I would have been totally fine receiving just the bottles on their own. But, when they actually arrived in the correct boxes but ones that have been oddly damaged, I start to wonder if they is something dodgy about what I just spent $130 on.",3.0

I love this fragrance. Every time I wear it I get compliments on it. I've even had strangers stop me in a store and ask me what I'm wearing. ordering on Amazon saves me money over  the big department stores and saved me a painful trip to the mall. Highly recommend Amazon prime!,5.0
"I agree with the 3 star reviewer, but I'm more annoyed ;) I'm an online shopper, and I could have gone to a department store and bought this for the same price, so imagine my disappointment receiving this substandard product. Like a previous reviewer, the scent of this dissipates so quickly, I can douse myself with the stuff (10 -12 sprays) and have the scent barely detectable 4 hours later. I've been wearing this lovely fragrance for half my life (I'm 32) and have always received compliments but not since wearing this product... no one can detect a fragrance!! The product is packaged well, sealed, looks authentic, marked as eau de parfum, smells pretty close (something is faintly off- when the top notes wear off, the middle notes fade into something wonderful with my scent, but that isn't there with this product- maybe bc it's really the eau de toilette?), and if it weren't for the fact that it just doesn't last (!) I might have questioned/ doubted my nose. This is a DON'T BUY!!Update: Went to the department store and bought another 2.5 oz bottle of Beautiful and finally did a comparison. Four sprays and the scent lasts forever. The product sold here is not the real stuff. The color of FrangraceGo's fake Beautiful is a faint yellow, while the real stuff is a deep gold. The bottle is actually slightly different, too- the printing on their bottle is in the wrong place. This company is charging full price + shipping for a fake product. Absolutely ridiculous!!!!!!!!",1.0

"I have used EstéeLauder's Beautiful since it first came out when I sold cosmetics at Nordstrom while in law school. This product IS NOT Beautiful. I compared the scent and all of the fine print on the bottle to AUTHENTIC Beautiful......NOT the same. This bottle of liquid smells like bug spray. The atomizer is different,bottle cap different, words on label on bottom different....most importantly, the scent is definitely NOT Beautiful. Having worn it for decades, I cannot be fooled. I actually ordered it at this unrealistic ally low price to see if  it is a knockoff.....in my opinion, IT IS. It came registered mail to California fromThailand, wrapped safely......but, ugh, I have been completely taken. Don't get caught!!!",1.0

"It might have the reputation as an old standby fragrance, but Beautiful is a classic.  If you're not sure about what your significant other might prefer, stay away from the new trendy scents and buy this.  That way you have a great comeback if she doesn't think she'll like it,  ""Honey, I saw the name and thought of you.""  Say that and I bet she tries it.",5.0
"I've worn ""Beautiful"" for over 20 years and have always received rave ""reviews"" from my friends when they detect its fragrance on me.

"This isn't so much a review of the product as it is a warning to all you guys buying for your sweetheart.I purchased this being fairly sure that her perfume was ""Beautiful"", and also fairly confident in Amazon's return policy if I was wrong. My bad, she wears ""Miracle"" and Amazon won't take this back.So I'm not so happy getting another one of those $77 lessons....to double check before ordering (even if it means letting her know what you are buying)! And if anyone needs a bottle of Beautiful, I have one I'll let it go cheap.",1.0

"Arrived in an envelope , so the box was all smashed and unsuitable for a gift. Scent and color is different from a bottle purchased from local department store. Not sure about this product being authentic because it differs from the authentic bottle I own. Also, scent is very short lived, it completely disappears in about an hour! Disappointed:(",1.0
"I have worn Beautiful by Estee Lauder for over 15 years.  I get compliments often.  Budget minded, I needed to find a better price that retail and Amazon was almost the most inexpensive one I could find.Beautiful By Estee Lauder For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5 Oz Unboxed.",5.0
"I received this product and it is not Beautiful by Estee Lauder, it has to be a knock-off.  I could tell as soon as I opened it and compared the bottle with my original bottle I already had at home, the color was off even the feel of the bottle was different.  And when I flipped if over it was not numbered like all my previour bottles have been.  I have been wearing this perfume for 22 years and this is the first time I have been ripped off. I ended up going directly to Estee Lauder to buy another bottle because I can not wear what I got from this seller.  This is what Estee Lauder told me when I told them what happened to me.

"This is my wife's favorite perfume so every Christmas I brave the cosmetics counter at Macy's to buy her a new bottle.  She loves it and prefers the scent to anything else on the market and has been using it for several years,  Of course I like it too :-)  Like most popular perfumes it's expensive, sort of like liquid gold.  As Christmas approached this year, I was behind on my shopping and having difficulties finding what I wanted.  I checked out Amazon and was surprised to find Estee Lauder Beautiful available, Then I read with dismay that there are lots of knock off perfumes out there for sale online.  After reading all the reviews I crossed my fingers, placed my order and received a box from Amazon just in time for Christmas.  Upon inspection, it's the real deal.  Wife is happy, I saved some money and didn't have brave the winter weather to go to the mall!",5.0
company was great but the perfume smelled like ant spray.  Purchased many times before.  Would buy from company again as they were gracious to return the item.,2.0
"I love Estee Lauder lBeautiful perfume, and have used it for many years.  Always get compliments.  It is a long-lasting, suttle, not overpowering aroma.  HOWEVER, this purchase may have been one of those knockoff's/impersonater things.  It was NOT the same perfume, it seemed to have been ""cut"" with another liquid.  I purchased a smaller bottle from a department store afterwards, and it was as it should have been.  I have ordered this product before from Amazon, and it was always as it should have been...........until this time, when it was definitely a fake.  Amazon customer service treated me right, as always.",1.0
"I don't think this is a legit version of Beautiful.  The fragrance is much fainter, like it's watered down.  When I ran out I went to the department store instead.",2.0
I believe this is Estée Lauder as it smells like the almost empty bottle I bought at a department store. But I do agree that the fragrance has changed somewhat from the past.It is still very light and clean smelling. Not too strong (which is why I love it). The scent lasted all day. I usually spray a little on my blouse as my skin is sensitive. At night I could still smell it on my blouse.,4.0
"This is not the original scent, this is a knock-off sold in the same bottle. My mom has used this fragrance for years,  we smelled them side by side from the bottle purchased in the department store. They were definitely different.",2.0
Very disappointing...... this product I have used before and loved it!What I received through amazon smelled like cat pea!  Old and stale!  Had thrown out the package wrap and could not return!  First major disappointment with Amazon.,1.0
"This is my favourite perfume but the reason I give it three stars is that the scent doesn't last long as the one I had before. I don't know if it's because it is old stock or had they change the mixture but the little Beautiful I have in my bottle which I had for years, that scent out last the one I bought lately from Amazon.",3.0
"I purchased this as a gift for someone who only wears this fragrance and was a bit nervous after reading some of the other reviews that said this wasn't the actual fragrance. However, it was the original product as described, and the recipient of this gift loved it. Personally to me, this fragrance is somewhat grandmotherly in it's musky, cloying scent, but I'm glad that she got what she wanted and enjoys it.",5.0
This product does not smell like the original version. We bought this thinking it was the original brand but something is different about it and does not smell good like the original per my wife that has been using this product for 15+ years.,1.0
"I am so thankful for all of your reviews. I am a Beautiful expert and I would have been VERY upset to have waited on my product only to find out it wasn't what I thought I was getting. All of my Beautiful sisters, be ware!!! We know what the bottle looks like on the picture and I can tell just from the selections that it is a lighter color and even though they do not disclose that it is like Beautiful Love or another of the sister products, we can tell. We know our brand!! Trust your gut. You probably had an inkling something was not right. Shame on you seller for not disclosing the mixup and addressing each of the customer concerns. You just lost a customer because you seem to be hiding and don't care about valued customers!!!",1.0
This fragrance is superb. Its just mesmerizing and so subtle but so addicting. I LOVE IT. I have also bought the Body powder and it also is just wonderful. You will not be disappointed. I have worn it and I get compliments. Everyone says its so soft but so nice and they want to write the name down. Don't hesitate. Its just delightful.,5.0
"Product was over the 3 year shelf life and smelled stale. I wrote to seller and within two days had a new bottle but same production code, its was the same old and stale. I just asked for my money back. My wife uses this perfume all the time so she knows what its supposed to smell like.",2.0
"I sent this parfum to my sister-in-law who has used Estee Lauder's Beautiful before.  She stated that this parfum was unsatisfactory, because neither she nor anyone at her Rehab Center could smell the fragrance.  Even a heavy spray on various areas was barely detectable.  She wondered if the parfum had been watered down.",2.0
"Sprayer came broken, amazon say's ""not eligible for return"" Seriously, what I am supposed to do with a broken 50 dollars bottle of perfume? Also, doesn’t smell like the original scent. But can’t tell for sure, because it’s broken! Very disappointed.",1.0
"A gift for my granddaughter. Her very first ""grown-up"" perfume. She loves it. I've loved it, as well, for over ten years when I received it as a congratulations gift. Not all scents smell the same on every woman. Before you buy one for someone else, take that into consideration.",5.0
"I usually buy this at Macy's, however, when I looked at the online price, it seemed pretty over priced.  This is a smaller bottle (not the largest) but worth the $50 charged for it.  I bought two.",5.0
"I've worked for Clinique, and Christian Dior cosmetics.  I've worn Estee Lauder Beautiful for years and I have not any problems at all with this product and the seller.  I love it!",5.0
"Delicious scent, sweet but not cloying. Any aromatic product should be sampled on the wearer's own skin (and this applies to men's as well as women's fragrances) so you can determine if it suits you. We all have different body chemistry.",5.0
"The most pleasing scent I have found in 50 years....light, airy, and doesn't change it's aroma when applied to my skin or clothing as many others do.",5.0
"Product was described as new but unboxed, and was scheduled to arrive no later than Dec 21st.  I was never contacted to let me know that shipping was delayed; it finally arrived Dec 27th.  The perfume had no cap and there was a sticker on it which read ""Demonstration only.  Not For Resale."" When I called the company to find out what was going on, they told me that I should have known ""unboxed"" meant ""tester"". They even sent me an email copy of their ad--- which states ""Testers and unboxed products are exactly the same as the regular perfume, except testers usually come in a plain box--with or without a cap.  Unboxed products are the perfume or bath product, only without the box"".  Tuccini gave me an RMA # and told me they would accept the return but that I would be responsible for shipping costs both ways, plus a hefty ""handling/restocking"" fee.  After weeks of calls and emails with Amazon (we filed an A-to-Z Guarantee Claim) and Tuccini, I finally received back the entire amount of the purchase, plus extra credit from Amazon.  Although I ultimately was taken care of, this was an absolutely awful experience, and I am dismayed to see that the Tuccini ad looks exactly the same (which I believe is misleading).  I further question whether Amazon should have such a business as one of its merchants;  is it even legal to resell testers?",1.0
I have always loved Estee Lauder's Beautiful. It's been my go to fragrance for years. I found the key with this one is to remember that less is more. It really stinks if you put to much on so it's best to spritz and then walk into the spray then you get a perfectly delightful smell that lasts a long time.,5.0
"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she was disappointed with the smell. Although it smells like ""Beautiful"" the oder seems not as strong as the bottle she bought at Macy's. Kind of like it's been watered down if that's possible.Very disappointedd and will be paying full price at larger department stores from now on. I guess you get what you pay for.",1.0

I was unable to return it. Beware of buying perfume online when it's not from the manufacturer, I suppose.",1.0
It is the only perfume I use and the price was 1/3 that I would pay at the department store.  I am very happy and will buy again.,5.0
arrived ahead of time. Everything packaged well. This fragrance is so very lovely. Makes me feel like I'm floating through a garden.,5.0

"Wow all these negative reviews . It's the real Beautiful people , smells amazing. I would definitely go get your noses checked .",5.0
My mom loves this stuff so I buy it every year for Christmas.  I haven't heard any complaints and doubt I will unless someone tries to ingest it.  This makes my mom smell like my mom so I highly recommend it.,4.0
"Item is as described in original box and seal was not tampered. I have been using this perfume for over 15 years and can honestly say this is not a fake. However, due to my experience with this perfume I believe it may have been a bit stale but definitely original. I've bought this perfume from large department stores in the past and after not using it for a long time I noticed that stale smell which is how I recognized it with this one. But it is very slight. If not, I would have contacted the seller about it. For the value of this perfume it is nothing to complain about. I would definitely still buy from this seller without a doubt!! I would highly recommend...great price!!!",4.0

"This was awful. Could not return. Husband bought as Christmas gift. The smell made me sick and I've worn ""Beautiful"" before. This did not smell right.",1.0
I like the perfume because it makes me smell pretty.  And the price is better than found at other retailers,5.0
My lady friend loves this perfume and I agree with her!,5.0
"Cheap knock-off.  The perfume looses its aroma after about 5 minutes, but since my wife has used this brand for years I know it should last for days....literally.  Also, the printing on the outside of the bottle wipes right off, unlike the good stuff she has bought from the department store for years.  I tried to surprise her with her favorite perfume by ordering since I could not get off work and go to the store.  She ended up throwing it away.  Will not buy this again.",1.0

Best fragrance ever,5.0
it is the exact same product i purchased at a mall store. The only difference is it is 30.00 cheaper at amazon. Was amazed at the differencein price. Plus my wife loves it.,5.0
I purchased this as a gift for a friend and she loved it.  The scent is light but very stimulating.  She reports that the perfume is identical to Beautiful she has purchased in the past so there was no indication of the problem reported by others about a counterfeited product.  Perfume is a very personal preference so I would recommend trying it at a local department store but I am very satisfied with the purchase.,5.0

"I love Beautiful perfume and have used it for many years. I have bought it online several times previously without a problem, but the last bottle was definitely rancid. It didn't come with the usual cover, so it might have been used or opened previously.  Amazon was kind to credit me for it and I threw it away.  Beware--smell it immediately to ensure you're getting fresh perfume. My husband bought me a fresh bottle from Macy's...and it's just beautiful!",1.0
"this is not what I expected at all since I had bought this ;previously  This is the very cheap, very high alcohol content and does not smell at all like their Beautiful product.",1.0
"This looked like the real Beautiful, but after a short period of being on your body, the odor turned to a sour odor. I have been using Beautiful for over 2 Decades and this is definitely not the right stuff, have to go to Macy's and get authentic Beautiful.",1.0
I purchased this as a gift for my fiancé. She asked for it by name. The perfume was delivered wrapped in its original box.The bottle was new/unopened. The fragrance is nice and not overpowering. It makes her smell as beautiful as she is.,5.0
excellent,5.0
My daughter is beautiful and the perfume matches her.,5.0
Delivered promptly but doesn't smell like it does in the store. Not sure if it is old or what is wrong. Very disappointed. Wish I had gone to the store so I could take it back.,2.0
As with  other purchasers I found this bottle to be unsatisfactory!! It may be less money bit it is also WAY less scent. I think it's a knock off. Even street it's first spayed on toy can hardly smell it.  I've used this perfume for years and this is the first bottle I've had a problem with. Purchasers beware!,1.0
One of my favorite perfumes!!  Great price too!,5.0
Soft scent for daily use. Will not over power others unless you have too much on,5.0
"This was a gift for my daughter in law. She mentioned several months ago how much she liked the perfume. I almost forgot to order, as I was so busy ordering for Christmas. However, I ordered in time to have it delivered ON HER BIRTHDAY!",5.0
I probably should have ordered a smaller bottle before knowing how well my wife liked it. It is a wonderful fragrance though.,5.0
This is my signature cologne.  It never fails that someone will comment on this lovely fragrance.  It must have something to do with my body chemistry because no other fragrance has caused so many comments.,5.0
I have bought Beautiful for many years and could not pass up this great price,5.0
I have been wearing Beautiful for 27 years...and that is not the perfume that was in the bottle that I received...So disappointed!,1.0
"At first I felt like this was an older scent, as my mom and granny wore it when I was growing up, and hesitated wearing it. BUT then I did, and I love it. It is a little strong at first, but that wears off quickly. The scent stays with me all day and smells so feminine and light and nice, and not too sweet. Every once in a while I'll catch a smell of myself and just smile. Definitely a keeper :)",5.0
Confortable size. Wonderfull fragance!,5.0
"I have been using this perfume for 3 bottles now. A co-worker was wearing it and it is such a lovely scent for a lady to wear. I mean the name for this is perfect. It is clean, has a touch of flowers and they say it has some citrus in it but I just know this is a wonderful wonderful perfume. I have had lots of compliments on it. They sell small bottles or if you dont care to do that go to Macy's or Dillards and ask for a sample. I think you just might get hooked. :-)",5.0

It doesn't seem to smell quite the same as the department store purchase.,2.0
I bought a bottle of Estee Lauder Beautiful 2.5 perfume as a gift for Christmas it was not packaged correctly and it slid around in the bigger box with other items and  the bottle was complexly smashed in it's own box. The scent was lingering among my other items in the big box. Very disappointed. Contacted them via e-mail- No response.,1.0

"My mother has been using Beautiful since it came out. I was shocked at how fast it was delivered. For those who are curious of the scent, it has a hint of sweetness and reminds me of a soft scent of Coco Chanel Mademoiselle",5.0
I love this perfume. My mother used to purchase this for me every year. She has pasted on now. It's nice to finally have this perfume gain after 7 years.,5.0
This is FAKE! Made in Switzerland stamped clearly on the back of the box. Very upset at the dishonesty.,1.0

Love this scent. I always get compliments when I wear it. Not overpowering or sickly sweet.,5.0
"This was my go to perfume for years, but when I went to restock, the fragrance had changed completely. It's not even close to the original. It really should not have the same name.  I checked the scent at Macy's and it was upsetting that the counter clerk insisted that the scent had not changed, when it obviously has. Estée Lauder should bring back the original Beautiful, but it doesn't make it anymore (check their website for other disappointed customers.) All their other fragrances (White Linen, Cinnabar, etc) have stayed the same. Beautiful should too!",1.0
"The price was great and the delivery was timely. Awesome experience,",5.0
This is not authentic.  I have been using Beautiful for 30 years.  I was so excited to see it here for a fraction of the price.  It is fake. It is darker than the real product and it smells like cheap spray. I called and got a reimbursement.  Be careful.,1.0
This was very rancid.  An old bottle.,1.0
great everyday scent. Easy to hold and bottle is sturdy. Spray mechanism well designed. Never breaks or clogs. Like the light not too flowery smell.,5.0
"My wife loves ""Beautiful.""  And I love ""Beautiful"" on my wife.  I usually gift her with a bottle in her Xmas stocking.  But oh how I hate to fight the crowds in a Department Store during the Christmas shopping season. .  So this year I checked Amazon, and sure enough, it was available.  And with our Prime membership, shipping was free.  The ""Beautiful"" way to shop!",5.0
"Been using this perfume since 1989.  It's my every day and special occasion perfume.  In other words, it's the only perfume I wear!",5.0
Maybe there was an ingredient change or maybe I got a knockoff. I have worn Beautiful for over 20+ years and this one has a “smoky cigarette” smell mixed with a hint of the original. It is gross smelling. I am not even able to use it as an air freshener.,1.0
Love this scent will be ordering more in the future,5.0

"I was very eager to receive my 2.5 oz. of Beautiful Spray Cologne. When it arrived and I opened up the package, the product was not a 2.5 oz. bottle (as shown and as advertised) but a 1 oz. bottle.

"I have used Estee Lauders' Beautiful products for many years.  They are always very high quality but they are also pricey.  I have used the bath gel, powder, lotion and cream, and parfum. I am happy that I have found a website where I can buy these products at a slightly reduced price.",5.0

"I helped my supervisor with an online order for this product at the Lauder website. When I placed the order the first time, I failed to enter a ""password,"" and when the page refreshed, it defaulted to standard shipping, which I didn't catch until after the transaction was complete. I called and was told that the shipping could not be changed but that the order would be cancelled and I could place a new order with the correct shipping. The order was not cancelled, and we received two shipments. I have now made FOUR calls to request a postage-paid return label. The first three times, they promised to e-mail the label. I have supplied 3 different e-mail addresses and received nothing. So I asked them to either fax it (they would not) or snail-mail it, which they said will take up to two weeks to receive. Meantime, my supervisor has a charge on his card for a package that is sitting on my desk unopened--plus $12.00 for the original  shipment that was supposed to be cancelled. Lauder's customer service failed 1) to permit changing the shipping method, 2) to cancel the original order, 3) to send a shipping label in a timely fashion. Crappy, crappy customer service. I'm very glad that I use Lancome products!",1.0

"This is the substance which my neighbor wore into the basement while doing her laundry. This perfume wafted up through my A/C system on a 95-degree day and hit me with the force of chemical Mace. To me, this perfume smells exactly the same as Cutter mosquito-repellant, only... a lot, LOT stronger. I got a whiff of ""Beautiful"" and fell to the floor INSTANTLY with convulsive dysentery, vomiting and blindess. EMT and police (about 20-30 minutes later when I could reach a telephone,) had to get the building super to open my door so they could scrape me up and haul me off to the hospital. The MIGRAINE this perfume can cause is indescribable. Toxicity of perfumes is a matter of degree: ALL are toxic, ALL are allergens, ALL are mostly synthetic hydrocarbon molecules which have never exited on Earth prior to chemists from companies like Estee cooking them up. I think women should be required to put a nice drop of this (or any perfume) on their own tongues prior to wearing it in public. If [you] can tolerate a nice dollop in the mouth, I can tolerate smelling it; because to me the reaction is the same. Smelling it *IS* getting a mouthful of it. You don't like my cigarette smoke, quit wearing toxic junk like this.",1.0
