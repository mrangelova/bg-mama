"I have used Estee Lauder Youth Dew for many years.  When I received this bottle I was very disappointed.  It was old and rancid.  A return does not seem to be an option.

I bought this as a gift for my grandmother.  My papa used to buy this for her thru out their marriage.  He has past away now though and it had been a while since she wore this.  I had memory's of this smell and recalled the bottle design.  My grandmother has used this for more than 20 years now.  She was so surprised that I remembered it and said it still smelled the same as when she first wore it.  It reminded her of her youth.  I must say this is a sweet oriental spicey smell much like a chai latte.  It is very warm and great for winter.  It is not my personal taste but I know many who compliment her on it.,5.0

"I first used ""Youth Dew"" many years ago.  At that time, Youth Dew was an OIL.  However, as a MALE, I did not want to smell ""perfumy""  so I would rub ONE DROP under each arm-pit after my shower, before going to work.  All the ladies at work would comment that I ""smelled fresh and clean, like I had  'Just stopped out of the shower.'  That is all I wanted to smell like.  Unfortunately, the Youth Dew today is a 'spray-on' cologne, and is far too much.  I now try just to 'spray it into the air and walk through it.'  Works fairly well, at least my niece tells me that I 'smell good.'",1.0

"I'm givin' this stink water a five-o-la because my girlfriend loves it.Personally, I cannot stant the stench of this stuff.  Makes me gag, and gives me a headach that no amount of Bourbon whiskey will cure.She loves it though, and she must be obeyed, if you guys know what I mean.Today, I told her, hey... why don't you keep that stuff out in yer car, so when you slather up with it in the morning, you don't stench up the whole abode, like you usually do?  That way, you could bathe in a bit more later for a touch up, and by your own logic, that awful foot odor from your rancid sneakers in the back seat might abate just a little bit too.She'll have none of that.Times like these, I resort to using Gunk Engine Brite, Hoppe's #9 or P.B. Blaster as face splashin' stuff, just to get even.",5.0

"Thank heavens I have a small bottle of the bath oil which I have been hoarding for years.  I also have an older bottle of the EDP.  It is so obvious that over a period of years, the corporate goons at Lauder, in an effort to keep costs down and to comply with the new and dreadful IFRA regulations, have made the once glorious and deep oriental wonder that WAS Youth Dew into a ghost of its former self.  My solution has been to use the oil first and follow it with the body cream, and then a brief spray over all of it.  I can get close to the way it used to smell.  I hope they just leave it alone now -- or else revive the old formula!!  I know I am not alone in this opinion.  We are legion.",3.0

"I bought this back on the site some months ago.  Youth Dew has become my signature fragrance over the past year.  It's floral, spicy, balsamic and powdery.  It's not a fragrance to blind buy.  But, if you like it, you will love it forever.  I always keep at least one backup of this scent, and I own the bath oil and deodorant.  I make my own powder and lotion by using the bath oil.  It's being sold here for a great price.  However, the bottle I got here was made in Switzerland, and some of the Estee Lauder and Clinique fragrances that are manufactured in Switzerland are weaker than their U.S.A. manufactured counterparts (Aromatics Elixir, I'm looking in your direction).  You may want to inquire where the bottle of perfume was made before you make a purchase here.  I suggest getting the U.S. bottles, because the scent in them is stronger.With all that being said, I applied this perfume after a bath at night.  It was still going strong 8+ hours later.  A beautiful and classic scent.",5.0
"This perfume must smell great on me because for years people still lean over to me, 61 years old, and say you smell good. The other thing that is wonderful is that Estee Lauder is trying to gauge customers. This perfume is reasonably not like the outrageous pricing of Dior and Chanel, who don't get that there are fewer and fewer people that can buy in their range due to new GOP.",5.0
"WOW!  For years, I looked at this stuff and was even afraid to spray it.  That weird brown liquid in the bottle was alarming.  And to sniff it from the bottle was ....WHEW!  Imagine my surprise when a woman I know gave me a hug and she smelled heavenly.  The absolute only time I ever asked anyone what they were wearing and she replied, ""Youth Dew.""  I finally decided to give it a try.  I purchased a bottle (it is still really cheap) and gave it two good sprays on my arm before bed. My initial reaction was, ""Oh no, this is just wrong.""  But five minutes later, it became very powdery.  After ten miutes, it was interesting.  By fifteen minutes later, I was in bed, inhaling my pajama sleeve.  When I woke up this morning, my husband said, ""I smell Bottlecaps.""  I said, ""What?""  He said, ""Bottlecaps.  The candy.  You know, the cola ones.  It smells really good.""  YES!  It strangely DOES have some sort of cola syrup smell, followed by a powdery amber cinnamon base.  It is delicious!  I am 35 years old and this is far from being old lady like.  I can understand the complaints from folks who say it is changed, even watered down.  Please understand that one of the primary components of this is oakmoss, which a few years back was regulated by the industry due to allergies and a lot of scents were forced to reformulate or stop being made.  So yes, it is somewhat different. But it is still way better than anything on the market today, scents that smell like candy and fruits.  There is a reason it has been around for 60 years.  In fact, my cousin just got married and Youth Dew is all she wears.  And she is 30 years old, not 95!  Please stop judging this scent by it's initial blast.  Give it a chance to blend with your body chemistry.  And only one or two sprays!",5.0
"This is a TRUE Story! My husband and I have been married 51 years. We've often tried to remember the name of the perfume I wore when we met. Through the years, I've tried different perfumes, but the fragrance just evaporated on me quickly. THEN, a Facebook friend from college commented on a post I made that she thinks of Youthdew. I commented, ""What's youth dew?"" She was flabbergasted that I didn't remember. So, my husband saw that and ordered it from Amazon. The first time I put it on, I knew and my husband knew that Youthdew was the fragrance!! And it DOES have staying power on me.",5.0
"This is a product that's been in my family for decades.My Dad's bought this for Mom for years,a kinda special gift that's shown up for different occasions over the years...Christmas,Valentines Day,Birthday....This year my Dad's now in a nursing home and Mom is at home,so Dad ask me to see if I could find it one more time for Mom for Christmas and Thanks to you  guys I did.He was so proud to give it to her and see acted like a teenager when she received it...So Thanks for helping me fashion a wonderful moment in their lives one more time.Youth Dew still works it's magic for them even though their in their 80's.....Thanks Again",5.0
"Years ago a cousin worked for Estee Lauder. She was always giving my mother bottles of Youth Dew. I hated the scent as a kid. For some reason I decided to give it a try as an adult.Pros- The scent smells good on me.- The scent lasts- A little bit is all you need. I put one spray into the bottle cap and apply to pulse points with a cotton swab. Seriously, that is all you need for the scent to last all night without being overpoweringCons-If you apply with anything but the lightest touch, it can be overpowering.- the scent lasts and lasts. When I wear it I usually apply after a shower in the late afternoon.When I wake up I can still smell it on me. It stays until I shower it off.",4.0
"I'm so glad I tried this scary-looking old fashioned perfume. It really is strong at first, then it settles down over the next 30 minutes, and after that it has a warm, earthy, kind of spicy scent that lasts all day and night. The first time I wore it, my boyfriend couldn't get enough of it; he kept telling me how great I smelled. It's become my signature scent, low-key but still warm and sexy. However, easy does it, not more than one or two squirts or they'll smell you on the next block!",5.0
"I have always liked Youth-Dew, particularly the addictive cola-like top notes and the powdery rose dry down, but somehow I could never actually wear it on my skin without the skanky animalic notes coming to the fore and ruining everything (it is these notes that cause many to shriek, ""Old lady!!""). For years I could only use the perfumed-soap version. Even the bath oil, which is subtler and closer to the skin, gave me a roaring migraine.Well, I have now been converted to the realm of Youth-Dew lovers! I think two things have happened: (1) Lauder has reformulated the EDP so that it is lighter and brighter, less cloying and funky, but still very much itself--  a glorious, femme-fatale classic. (2) I have learned how to apply with restraint. I mean, half a spray on the nape of my neck to start, and maybe half a spray in the cleavage if I want a more full-on dose. Applied correctly Youth-Dew is anything BUT old-lady! It's an intoxicating, boozy, cognac-smooth love potion of spices and blooming flowers and earthy patchouli and hippie head-shop resins and delicate powdery woods. My signature! And, I'm convinced, the inspiration for great Oriental scents of newer vintage, from Angel to Opium.If you like fruity body sprays and sticky gourmands and hyper-clean soapy florals-- and believe me, I like all of the above-- the first whiff of Youth Dew on your skin might shock you a bit. It's heady, it's a little dirty, and it's not the least bit innocent. But good Lord it's a beauty, and just right for me.",5.0
"My Mom wore this for years & you knew when she was coming, where she had been & which apartment was hers by the smell of Youth Dew. And it was pleasant, don't take me wrong. What inspired me to buy some was the other day I ran across an item of hers that had been stored with some other things for awhile, picked hers up & believe it or not, caught the scent of Youth Dew. No one in our family has used that since she has been gone and she passed in 1998. I came to visit my brother and his wife & I were talking & I told her about it & she knew right away what I meant cause mom lived with them for 10 years. So my sister-in-law & I decided to buy some ourselves since it had been long enough since mom had been gone. Boy, were we ever surprised. It smells absolutely nothing like it did when mom used it and she would spray it in the air, on her clothes in the closet, on her bed, anywhere she could so it is not a body chemical reaction thing. My sister-in-law's best friend said she knew it had changed as well. Tell me, what has been done to it? It was so sweet the way it was.",2.0
"I used Youth Dew 50 years ago.  I can't imagine why I stopped. Probably because so many new fragrances where being introduced to the ,I ordered it, put it on yesterday, still love it. Very different than most fragrances on the market. Not too floral, only use a little.I have a small diffuser and reeds. I have not purchased oil yet, I was thinking why can't I use a little bit of Youth Dew oil in the duffuser with the reeds.  I know you have to buy essential oil.  I put a small amount of the youth due fragrance I received yesterday into the small glass placed the reeds in.. When I enter the room , the room smells wonderful.  So I am now purchasing the oil..  I won't be using any lights or flames, so I don't have to worry about fire.  I am going to try it.",5.0
"Youth Dew is an older scent, and thus often put down by fans of trendier and more modern perfumes. I have to wonder if it's a knee jerk reaction to the age of the formula. It's a sexy, complex, and sometimes overly strong scent. Funny how people will disparagingly label something as ""old lady."" Gee, tons of people are naming their babies with ""old lady"" names...just because something is originally from one time period doesn't mean it can't re-become ""modern"" in another!I'm 46, and I grew up loving but not wearing Youth Dew. It was my mother's signature scent. When I was a HS senior, my boyfriend, not knowing it was my mom's scent, gave me a small bottle. He was so offended when I told him I wouldn't wear it! I said that it said, ""Mom"" to me and that I wasn't ""old (mature) enough to wear it."" I gave Mom the bottle.It was many years, and after Mom's death in 1994, that I finally bought some - to celebrate being a mom myself. And I still do think it's a ""mature"" scent. It lingers a long time, especially on clothes you've worn, like a winter coat.My husband loves Youth Dew! Still, I cannot wear this scent in warm weather. I am a naturally ""warm"" person, I sweat easily, and the scent is overpowering to me in the heat. Even in the winter I wear it sparingly. I feel the same way about¬†Chanel No 5 Women, 3.4oz / 100ml EDP, SPRAY, NEW & SEALED. I more often wear something lighter, like¬†JOY by Jean Patou¬†or¬†WHITE LINEN by Estee Lauder EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY 2 OZ for WOMEN.I have read that a lot of people think the formula has changed since my mother's time, but honestly I can't smell a difference. From what I am reading, they are correct and my sniffer is off! The change can't be too large though, or I know I'd notice it.Top notes: Orange, spice note, bergamot, peach, aldehydes;  Heart notes: Clove, rose, ylang-ylang, cinnamon, cassie, jasmine, orchid; Base notes: amber, tolu, patchouli, olibanum, oakmoss, peru balsam, benzoin, vanilla",4.0
"I have been wearing YD since 1998 and I adore it. It is one of the few fragrances that lasts and lasts on me.  After I use it, I can still smell it on my clothes for days.  I am told YD has a high concentration of essential oils and that is what makes it so long lasting.If you like sweet, complex scents, this one could be for you.  I would probably classify it as a spicy floral with rose and jasmine as top notes.  As the fragrance wears, the spices deepen and I think, become more pronounced until you end up with primarily sweet and spicy bottom notes.Before you buy a bottle, go to someplace like Sephora or Ulta and try it on. Live with it for at least 4 hours before you decide to buy. The price is quite reasonable for a high-quality designer scent such as this.",5.0
"Youth Dew is getting harder to find in stores, so I was very happy to find it here at such a great price. It was a gift for my mother as that is all she wears, and she was very happy to receive it. Thanks, Est√©e Lauder!",5.0
"I sat next to a lady at a Celtic concert and I was getting a hint of this beautiful scent every now and then.By the end of the show I had to ask her and she told me it's an old favorite Yourth Dew by Est√©e Lauder.I told her It was aromatherapy in this outdoor setting.  Great for the senses. Hence, I had to order it.",5.0
I disagree with other reviewers that say the fragrance is different.  I've been using this for decades and it smells the same to me.,5.0
Still holds true; nothing smells quite as good as good 'ol Youth Dew...although I could swear it doesn't last as long as it used to. Disappointed that they had to tamper with it and disrupt its staying power.,5.0
"I've worn Youth Dew for years and have always bought it through Macy's. When I saw that Amazon carried it, I was thrilled. Same price, but no-cost shipping on Prime, and I didn't have to go shopping. (I hate shopping.) So I bought it and got it a couple days later, and it just doesn't smell the same as Youth Dew -- believe me, I know how Youth Dew's supposed to smell; nor does it last even half as long as the perfume I've been buying from Macy's for years. So I guess it's back to get-in-the-car-drive-to-Macy's-and-buy. Yes, I realize there are more important problems in the world. But when you spend $34 on a bottle of your favorite perfume, you want it to be your favorite perfume.",1.0
"Very disappointed in the Youth Dew I received.  Packaging is the same but the product inside is different, not the same fragrance and only lasts a short time where others lasted for many hours.  I always received many compliments in the past when I used it, nothing now using the bottle I purchased here on  Amazon.  I won't be buying this type of product from Amazon in the future, I will buy a new bottle of Youth Dew at a store soon where I can make sure it is the fragrance I want not the fake I received.  My product says made in Switzerland, they must use a different formula so make sure you do research before you buy.",1.0
"I wore Youth Dew and Tresor exclusively for 20+ years, then switched to Je Reviens and Obsession. Summers I wore something lighter like Heaven Sent or Jontue, and roll-on essential oils like honeysuckle or sweet grass.When I got my tax return this year I impulsively bought a bottle of Youth Dew for a lot more $$$ than here on Amazon! Everytime I wear it at work I get (mostly young) guys telling me I smell fantastic and ask what I'm wearing! They had never heard of it, or smelled it, before. I showed them this listing on Amazon so they could buy it for their wives/gfs!",5.0
"My mom loves this perfume, personally this reminds me of my childhood because my mother would spray it around the house and made everything smell like it, including me.",5.0
Mothers favorite for one reason or another. Its very vintage esque in smell in contrast to all this fruity stuff lingering in the air these days.,5.0
"I can't believe I used this perfume a long time ago.  Then I began using Estee which was removed from the market, so I bought this again.  My son asked if I was burning incense.  I offered it to my cleaning lady and she didn't like it either.",2.0
"My husband has bought me this perfume for many years, saw this on the internet a lot cheaper so bought a bottle. When I opened the delivery the perfume was packaged as I would expect it to be in an identical box which was sealed in cellophane but I noticed on the outside of the packaging at the bottom a small sticker which said 'new'. On opening the perfume and using it for the first time it did not smell like the Youth Dew I am used to, I asked my husband if he liked my 'new' perfume he remarked it smelled of chemicals. Perhaps it is a new take on Youth Dew but I will not be using it.",1.0
"I am fourteen years old (as I have already stated)And, I LOVE this scent! What is this scent exactly?..I mean, what are the undertones used in this perfume? Whatever they are, they smell amazing. I actually find this better than Amazing Grace by Philosophy. This was a great buy, and I am highly addicted to this scent now. But, be careful, the scent is strong,and it lasts VERY LONG, so you only have to use between one or two sprays if you prefer. Anyways, I would recommend Youth Dew for anyone who wants a perfume that smells good and actually lasts at the same time. :D",5.0
I expected to get the bow on the bottle (as pictured) & wonder if this bottle was used. (It was for a gift to someone who knows this perfume &  bottle appearance.),1.0
"My mom wore this when I was growing up! Still love it and it's in the same bottle. I love that unlike other perfumes, this was has stayed the same over the years. Now my daughter wears it too.",5.0
"My Mother, Aunt and Mother-In-Law all wore this and when I saw it, I just had to buy it. It smells wonderful, and although all three wonderful ladies have passed, when I wear this scent, I can almost feel their hugs and hear their laughter.",5.0
"Scent does not last, waist of money.",1.0
"I bought this as it was recommended as an old perfume, which always intrigue me. Old, as in first produced as a scent in the beginning of the 20th century. I read all the reviews I could find, most of which were against the smell of the Youth Dew. It IS a very, VERY strong scent, and not a nice one, either.  I'm glad I bought it though, as I can truly say that I tried it. This is another one of those perfumes, like Joy, that I find to be not only not a nice smell, but horrid.I don't think Youth Dew is a nice scent, but that may only be me. I prefer Oriental perfumes. such as Shalimar, but this was not good for me, even though it is an Oriental perfume as well. Not nice at all.",1.0
This perfume is old smelling. Apparently it isn‚Äôt ordered very often. I won‚Äôt order perfume on Amazon again.,1.0
"I cannot understand it. I bought the perfume spray, couldn't believe how bad it smelled, realized I would have to buy EXACTLY what I remember having smelled so heavenly when I was 15, the BATH OIL, bought it, and it smells the same. Whatever that gorgeous smell was, it is lost. Forever, I guess. And no returns allowed on liquids. Costly selfish purchases on my part. I'll have to do without some things I might actually have enjoyed to feel less crummy about it. This is NOT the fault of the sellers. Both my orders of this scent arrived quickly, new, unopened, packaged as pretty as can be. But about 5 years ago, my teenaged (youngest) son mentioned that the worst smelling ""girl's perfume"" he'd ever smelled was Youth Dew by Estee Lauder. He called it ""unbearable."" I didn't believe him. Then I thought it must depend on the nose of the smeller. Or maybe the gender? But I'm past 60 now, widowed, and don't care how my perfume affects the nostrils around me, only whether it pleases my own. Many years ago, this beautiful scent came into being. I first smelled it emanating from a glamorous cousin (she was a medical resident), it filled the whole 2-story house when she walked in and pulled the towel off her hair and ran upstairs to visit my mother as per usual. Right away, my mother was wearing the scent, and I got a whisper of a dab for the few dances and dates I was allowed to go on at 15. Over the next decade, this luscious smell grew so popular that it could only drop out of fashion, because literally everybody was wearing it. Thereafter, for many years, the scent was gone, as far as I could detect. Now I know my son was right: he was just talking about today's Youth Dew by Estee Lauder, not that original glorious musk right out of a novel about old-time shieks with harems. People obviously KNOW what it smells like now, yet keep buying it, paying nearly twice what a nice-size squirter of spicy Calvin Klein Obsession would cost. Or DO they? Maybe it just sits in stock for whoever hasn't yet learned better to buy it only once. I wish all these other reviews had been accurate. Sure would have put me in a sweeter mood. I will probably keep dabbing it on after bathing, hoping my nose will change its mind, that so many fine reviews could not possibly be mistaken or exaggerating or loyal to an eerie fault....",1.0
AAAAAA++++++THANKS,5.0
Sprayed it on at Macy's and was so revolted I had to use wet wipes to scrub it off. It smelled like a toilet containing stale urine... Modern Muse is much better.,1.0
This product is a watered-down version of what I used to use years ago.  I use it now as a room spray.  It is more like a toilet water; must have been old.  Buy from a reputable department store.,1.0
Smells old...like vinsger.,1.0
"When I was a little girl this bottle was always on my Moms dresser. She never indulged much on herself, but this was her one vice. Since she passed away many years ago, I decided to buy a bottle, just so I could indulge in the scent to remind me of her. The best scent they make in my opinion.",5.0
An oldy but goody.  This perfume will live forever..long lasting with a gentle spice....good stuff,5.0
"I just received my order of Este Lauder Youth Dew perfume. I have worn this for probably 35 years.  This fragrance did not even resemble the fragrance that I so love.  In trying to save a couple bucks, by ordering through Amazon, I'm wondering if I received a very old expired bottle.  The packaging and the bottle were exactly the same as in the past but the smell was completely off.  Go to Este Lauder on line, pay a couple more bucks, and receive free shipping and returns through them. This will be returned!!!",1.0
"I have been wearing Youth Dew ever since 1967 when I bought my first bottle for college.  I have loved it ever since.  It is the one fragrance that does not get ""odd"" on my body.  I use just a slight spray on my lower neck and half spray on one wrist, rubbing on the other.  I don't want to smell up a room, but when I hug folks, I want them to enjoy the wonderful fragrance.  I have been complemented on Youth Dew for over 45 years now!",5.0
"WARNING: It looks the same - same bottle, same box.  Different perfume.  I know for sure, because I still have an original bottle I've saved from years ago.  This scent is not floral or ""heavenly"" as some of us describe the old perfume.  This is masculine with spices and a salty odor.  THIS CANNOT BE RETURNED -- so DON'T BUY IT ONLINE!!!!!",1.0
I love this,5.0
"Youth Dew is a classic fragrance for women by Estee Lauder. It is a spicy  floral, powerful yet soft. I love the fragrance and the body lotion. You get wafts of jasmine and rose warmed by patchouli and spice. Amazing.",5.0
Not so great,1.0
"I've worn Estee Lauder Youth Dew since the 1970s, when it was a favorite with my mother.  It smells beautiful at any age, and the unique bottle looks great on your dresser.  Rich, clean, sweet scent.  Be sure to try the powder, too.",5.0
This smells so yummy!  I'm not an expert in describing a smell. I just know what I like. I continuously smell my wrist all day since it lasts forever.  I know this has been around since The 60's....but other scents come and go and this one never smells old fashioned,5.0
"I love Estee Lauder's ""Youth Dew""...unfortunately, they are pricing theirselves out of the market place...as I understand it, they will be increasing their prices every 6-months...per one of their spokespersons.  I know for me, it's getting harder for me to be able to afford it...",4.0
"I haven't made my purchase as yet but I've worn this years ago and really loved it...I would wear it after I shower from a work-out and when I reach home it drove my dog wild, she would jump all over me and sniff me like crazy, it was such a joy to watch her enjoy my fragrance.....I will be purchasing this soon, my dog has past:( but I hope it will have the same effect on my husband:)",5.0
Bought this as a gift and was told it was mainly water,1.0
My mother's favorite perfume. It was a Christmas gift for her and she loved it. It reminds me slightly of baby powder. It has a sweet smell that reminds me of my mom every time I smell it anywhere.,5.0
Should be called Youth Pew!  Hated the smell.  Not like the original sent from years ago.  Maybe they added skunk oil to it. Buy at your own risk.,1.0
just like it always was. used this as my signature in the 60's. a little costly but worth it. a very little goes a long way.,5.0

"I first smelt it in a magazine and i thought it was  different.I tried it at sephora and i liked it.It has a classic base but with modern tones which makes it enjoyable.I can smell the moschus essence in it,which makes this perfume so sexy and delicate and hard to forget.Even my brother who never comments on any of the perfumes i like said it was mysterious and really nice,andyou know how much a man's opinioninfluences us on such matters!Overall,i like this perfume but i think a more mature girl would wear it.Maybe a 25year old girl,wearing a brown and cold transparent cocktail dress with bronze accessories,hair down anduntidy with golden highlights,tanned skin anda hint of shimmer on cheeks,lips,decollatage and shoulders.That's the picture i get when i smell this perfume!",5.0

"I have an elderly woman friend, and this is her signature fragrance; every time I hug her I can smell the fragrance. I often mention it to her, but since she wears it all the time; the fragrance is on everything she wears. I LOVE IT, and hope to get some eventually.",5.0
"My Ma had worn this since she was 16 and she's 65 now. I gag at the smell in the store but on her it smells SO good! Part of it may be that it's just the way my Mama smells but her body chemistry must just work well with it. So I came on here looking for it to have sent to her for Grandparents Day and I was shocked at how high the prices are. I paid like $27 for it at Nordstrom. Additionally...this perfume bottle is in no way heavy or bulky, thus, I don't believe for a hot minute that it would cost $10.99 to ship. I shipped it in a small flat rate box for $5 and change. One of my major pet peeves is when sellers try to jack up the price of their item by adding to the shipping. That's the first thing I look at. As a seller myself I ship 90% of what I sell for free.At any rate, although I love Amazon and spend way to much time and $$ on here buyer beware. There are much better prices elsewhere.",3.0
"This is an excellent product.  The fragrance lasts a long time, and blends with your skin.  People will often ask me what I am wearing, because it is a smell that lasts a long time and is memorable.It arrived shortly after it was ordered, without any hassles.  I would highly recommend it to women, and order it again for myself.",5.0
I've worn this fragrance for many years and received so many compliments! I even had one man run after me (seriously!) in a store asking what I was wearing:) But now . . .I noticed changes a long time ago - the lotion that used to be so rich was now lightweight - both in texture and fragrance. Then the fragrance starting changing until today it is no longer the unique and wonderful fragrance it once was. They took  a beautiful and classic fragrance and just ruined it. Another reviewer said it best - it now smells like bug spray.I quit buying two years ago. It's like losing part of myself - I was so identified with Youth Dew.,1.0
"The YOUTH DEW by ESTEE LAUDER for women perfume I purchased as a gift mid 2014 turned out to be FAKE when I gave it 1/2 a year later. So disappointed. Always buy perfume from a reputable place or department store. Try to keep product and all receipts, just in case, for returning.",1.0
smells like purity class,5.0
"I received this as a Christmas present this past year and it was the most horrendous thing I have ever smelt.  If I were to describe it, I would say that it's a weapon of mass destruction.  The scent clung to my skin and clothes and stunk up the whole room after one little spray.  Now, I'm 20 years old, so maybe that's why I hate it so much.  I'm into fruity and floral scents and this perfume is just toxic and disgusting.  But if you're looking for a powerful perfume, this stuff is very POWERFUL.  It certainly clears up your sinuses.",1.0
"was very disapointed with this. it didnt smell as i remebered it actually smelled like it was old, very strong and unappealing. i used to wear this scent and if it had smelled like this i wouldnt have. what a shame some companies try to push off their old products in place of new.",1.0
"THIS PERFUME makes me feel really warm.  Great for snowy days out.  When I smell this perfume on others I get annoyed, so when I wear it I try to tone it down a bit so as not to annoy others, but if it weren't for being considerate I'd drench myself in this.  Yum...  the bath oil may be perfect ...",5.0
That has to be the most awful perfume ever!!! I'm surprised that Estee Lauder hasn't discontinued it yet. It's nauseating to say the least!!!,1.0

"My first encounter with this scent was on an airplane. After getting to our seats, I asked my fianc√© a little too loudly , ""Doesn't it smell like toilet bowl cleaner on this plane?"" That's when I noticed the little old lady behind us with her torn open duty free bag on her lap, violently spritizing youth dew all over her neck as if it was truly the water from the fountain of youth. Let me tell you, this is NOT the fountain of youth. In fact, if I had to liken the scent to anything else my nose has regretfully encountered, I'd say it has notes of my grandmothers underwear drawer/athletes foot powder. I was reminded of this intrusive, unpleasant perfume this afternoon, at my local grocery store. I was selecting a cheese when a 'snobby' looking blue haired diva strutted down the aisle in her diamonds and drapers outfit, reeking of 'the dew.' I looked at my fianc√©, and his eyes widened with disbelief. ""My nose! Stop raping my nose, youth dew!"" He jokingly whispered to me as we scurried away from the youth dew fallout zone (which was most of the grocery store). Please, unless you want to smell like the inside of a centenarians coffin, do not buy this youth dew, or as I like to call it, ""death nectar.""",1.0
I believe Youth Dew by Estee Lauder was it's first scent introduced back in the 1950's.A must have for all perfume collectors such as myself...but I don't suggest wearing it...Way too strong and woodsy. Smells like bug spray.Alcohol content in this seems very very high.My suggestion buy it for the bottle...but keep the perfume in the bottle.,1.0
