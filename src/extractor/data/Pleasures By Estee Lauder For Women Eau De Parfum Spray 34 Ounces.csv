"Estee Lauder's Pleasures perfume is one of my all-time favorite scents. When I ran out of it a couple of months ago, I did not feel inclined to go to the mall and so I waited and waited, until I saw that it was being sold here on Amazon. Well, I am happy to report that it is the original Pleasures scent that lasts all-day, literally. The bottle arrived in its original packaging and when I sprayed it, I found that a little goes a long way, just as I remembered it. The scent remained on me all through my work day, and the fresh fragrance did not smell bad at all, as some of the older reviews here state. I'm not sure if this is a vendor issue, but mine smells just as I remember it, and is long-lasting too. The price here, for the largest bottle, is also good value.",5.0
"I am not sure whether it is ""old"" or adulterated but it is quite different from what I remembered.  I might get used to it in time.",3.0

"I have worn Pleasures since it first appeared and continue to get as many compliments (from men and women) about how good  it smells.  Have tried other fragrances throughout the years, but this one seems to fit my personality  since it is floral and slightly sweet whereas something like 'Envy' or other aggressive scents do not reflect my outlook. Probably more suited for a younger woman, but I continue to wear it as I am young at heart at 50. One thing though, this 1 OZ size is smaller than the size I usually buy in the Dept. Store  (1.7 OZ) so it may not be as good as a $$ value for some buyers.",5.0

"My wife has been using Pleasures for several years and has refused to use any other kind.  When I removed the product from the box and sprayed a little on her, she remarked ""That's not Pleasures, it doesn't smell the same"".  We also discovered the scent did not last as long as previous bottles of Pleasures.  To me, it appeared to be a weakened version of the fragrance.",1.0

"I am a Pleasures Addict!  I've tried so many others but always, always, always come back to Pleasures.  The original ""Victoria Secret"" perfume was my number one, but they stopped making it.  Calandre by Paco Rabanne was my number one, number one, but they stopped making/selling in the USA and now the stuff is so expensive, it's way out of my range.  So now, its jut me and Estee's Pleasures and Beautiful.  These are my ""staples.""  They used to make an oil that was outrageously wonderful, but they don't do that anymore...hmm...maybe I'll do that!  I also love the glitter lotion they make, as well as the body cream.  Body cream stays on longer and more fragrant than the lotion.",5.0

"Been using Pleasures Eau De Parfum Spray for several years.  I love it because it is strong and light at the same time and leaves a delicate layer of scent on my clothing.  It's not the ""knock-out"" type of scent that sends sinus sufferers and people with sensitive noses running out the door.  Pleasures is a very elegant and feminine scent that I never tire of and it keeps me from buying anything else.  When I go to the store, I sample many different perfumes but always come back to Pleasures when it's time to order.  Thank you Estee Lauder.",5.0

"I searched all over the Internet on and off since last Christmas looking for the best deal and free shipping for my favorite perfume and size: Estee Lauder Pleasures for Women Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 ounce bottle. As usual, Amazon was the BEST DEAL with FREE SHIPPING!!! It is not always easy to find this size for such a great deal, so I purchased TWO bottles of my favorite perfume  because this price was such a GREAT deal. The official web site charges $82 plus shipping and department stores mark up to $85 or more for the 3.4 oz bottle.  The product looked just as if I purchased it at the department store...in the pink box with plastic wrap...but the big difference was the PRICE!!! I would definitely purchase this product again....and again!!!",5.0

"A couple friends raved about this and said it is a fresh scent so I impulsively bought a bottle on Amazon.  It is one of the stranger experiences I've had with perfume.  The first few times I used it, it did not smell good at all.  Then finally, I started to smell a better smell.  And then I got a compliment so I had confirmation that there was a scent and that it is pleasant.  But I don't know that I'd buy this again.  When I wear it, I can't really smell it even if I hold my wrist to my nose.  Strange.  Too much money to spend to be puzzled by the experience.",3.0

I purchased this perfume based upon a sample that I pulled from a magazine.  The tones are soft and not overpowering and it lasts a long time.

And check price, I think I overpaid for a tester.  So why am I keeping it?  It's a very good perfume, both my wife and I like it.  We recommend it, I bought Pleasures intense from a different dealer,whom we gave 5 stars because they were fast, brand new in box, and it's very hard to tell the difference in scent.  You could buy either one as long as its Eau De Parfum.  Get the better price deal.  And read the ad very closely.",1.0

"I usually purchase larger bottles of this perfume but this time I purchased the 1 oz size.  It is smaller than I am used to but I do like it for the ease to put in my overnight bag when I travel or can put at office desk to freshen up if needed during the day.  Although this perfume is soft and has such a fresh scent I get many compliments when wearing.  It is my ""staple"" perfume that I use most daily as the fresh scent is not overwhelming but quite pleasant.  Always pleased with this perfume as well as the distributor was prompt in sending as well.  Very pleased.  Would suggest anyone to purchase this as it has a very non-overpowering scent and is good for any kind of mood you are in.",5.0
Great deal on this high quality perfume,5.0
"Waited forever to get this after ordering. I was completely out of perfume. THIS IS NOT PLEASURES PERFUME!!!!  I have worn that scent since it was introduced many years ago.  This smells watered down and different and disappears after a few minutes. I compared the perfume smell to authentic body lotion and it was COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!!  I am so sad I have to rebuy it now.  My body lotion was made in USA, the perfume was made in Switzerland.  BEWARE..... ONLY BUY PRODUCTS MADE IN USA!!!!",1.0
"I've been wearing pleasures perfume by Estée Lauder since 1995..I know the smell very well.This is not the real deal.Do not waste your money on this product.Also, pleasures perfume is made in the USA. The bottom of the bottle says made in Switzerlandz.Customer service was very apologetic and refunded me in the full amount.",1.0
"This is more of a light spring/summer scent.  Pleasures contains notes of peonies, lilies, Baie rose, and jasmine.  While the first three are subtle, and comprise the undertones, the jasmine is stronger.  When the oils have been warmed by your body's temperature they meld into a soft scent, reminiscent of a flower garden after a rain or, that first step into a florist's shop.  It's definitely feminine.As with all Estee Lauder's perfumes, spray lightly.  These are quality fragrances and more than a couple of sprays will leave you--and those around you--choking.  To get even more lasting power (from any fragrance), use the body soap/gel, apply the powder, and finish off with a spray of the perfume.Estee Lauder perfumes are 'signature' scents.  From the decades-old Youth Dew to Pleasures, each is comprised of enough of the essential oils that make it a unique scent that, is different as it blends with each body's individual chemistry.  This company does not skimp on these key ingredients.  That means the fragrance lasts for many hours.  Both you and those near you will enjoy Pleasures long after an eau d' toilette has vanished.",5.0

ESTEE LAUDER PLACERES EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY 1 OZ. SE EVAPORA EN MENOS DE UNA HORA ME LO PONGO PARA IR AL TRABAJO A LAS 8 AM Y A LAS 10 AM YA NO TENGO LA FRAGANCIA ES COSTOSO PARA LA MALA CALIDAD,3.0
"I was delighted to find my favorite perfume in such a large size at such a low price.  It came quickly ( I am a prime member), and I opened it up and began to use it right away.  I noticed that the fragrance was not as strong as usual, but  I have had some sinus issues lately and attributed my sensation to that.  Long story short, I have used about 1/4 of the bottle, and I have found that the fragrance is indeed a lot less intense than the bottles I buy in the department store.  I have used Estee Lauder perfume for years -- my signature fragrance--and I  pay more for it because it is intense and it lasts almost all day long for me, even when I use very little.  I can put this perfume I got from this order on and within minutes of spritzing it, I can barely smell the fragrance at all.  I asked my husband if he could smell it on me, and he said it was very faint...hardly noticable at all.  I don't know if it was on sale because it was in surplus  in the warehouse and perhaps the fragrance has lessened because it sat so long or what, but I am very disappointed.  I saved NOTHING by buying the larger bottle because I have to use three times as much and I have to use it several times a day to have any continuity of scent.  I am well past the return date for this purchase now, so I cannot return it or get my money back.  I guess I have learned that what appears to be a super bargain can sometimes turn out to be a major disappointment and huge waste of money.  Take my advice and purchase your fragrances in the department store when they are on sale there.",2.0
This perfume is not thr real pleasure Check the bottom part of the perfume  the one that said make in Ny is the real one . I bought the one make in ny and stay on me all day the one make in Switzerland  stay  for less than a hour.Do not waste you money,1.0
"I didnt read the reviews when I ordered this but later I did after I had ordered it and I got kinda scared cause I love Pleasures and wanted the real thing, so glad I didnt read them cause I would have missed out on a great deal and getting what I really wanted, I open it when I got it and wore it and it last so no watered down here and when I need this item again and it's for a great price so I can get it again cant missed out it's a win win nothing to lose...thanks for the great item and great price",5.0
I was very disappointed in this perfume. I have been buying Pleasures perfume for years and never been unhappy with the fragrance but feel this has been watered down. One or two light sprays would be more than enough not with this one-- it also looks yellowish in the bottle. No more purchasing from this seller,1.0

"This was my favorite fragrance for many years, I wouldn't wear anything else. The base notes are Sandalwood and Patchouli and I have always worn those two scents well, the top notes are lilies, peonies and jasmine and they are a heavenly combination. I still keep a bottle of this on hand and wear it if I'm going to an elegant event, I think this scent is wears well for special occasions and I like to mix up my fragrances so I don't get bored. This is just simply a beautiful perfume to have in my collection and I don't see it every leaving.",5.0
"Have worn Pleasures for several years.  It is definitely one of my favorite fragrances, and people often ask what I am wearing and seem to like it as well.",5.0
"I did my research before purchasing this bottle.Buying this bottle of perfume off of Amazon was $30 dollars cheaper than buying from Estee Lauder or any other fragrance company. The bottle was in the original box and cellophane.I am a little hesitant that the smell is not 100%, but my boyfriend who worked in a perfume facility said it is most likely a brand new bottle and needs to steep, which will over time make the smell better.",5.0
"I used to always wear this perfume back in the day.  I was very young and I thought this perfume smelled great in the store.  When I purchased it and would apply it to my skin it just smelled too strong and airy.  I ended up having a bad reaction to this perfume, more like an allergy and I was always sneezing.  This perfume was just too strong and did not smell all that pleasant.  It kind of me reminded me of an aerosol spray.  I just could not believe how awful it smelled.  Eventually I stopped wearing it and never brought it since.  This perfume was horrible IMO.",2.0
"I have been wearing Pleasures for at least 20 years, and usually go to Lord and Taylor paying more money. I get make up I don't use, and getting my perfume delivered to my home is wonderful. It's the real thing, and I smell great.",5.0
Bogus product. It arrived looking brand new but it has no scent. I've been wearing Pleasures for nearly 20 years and always received compliments. After wearing this and never receiving 1 compliment I asked my husband to check the scent and he agreed there is no scent. Beware don't trust this product.,1.0
"This is a fake. Please don't buy it. The posting said product was made USA, but the box said it was made in Switzerland. The fragrance is not as strong as Pleasures is, and disappears after a few minutes. I have used Pleasures for YEARS, and it's very hard to get rid of the smell. This one is definitely not the real deal.",1.0

"If you like floral and light feminine scents, you should sample this scent PLEASURES by Estee Lauder. It isn't always easy to find a floral and romantic scent. A few floral scents exist, and this is one of the best I think as it smells natural and is light. I like combining the perfume with the body lotion and bath powder for a layered scent.",5.0
I have warn Pleasures for many years. I think the size and price is great but it just does not have the same smell as the store bought ones. I am disappointed.,3.0
"Free sample of pleasures was enclosed when I bought Estee Lauder products from Macys, and  I got hooked because  the smell is  classic and feminine. For me, the aroma  does not last a whole day so I had to retouch once during the day, though not always.",4.0
"Paid nearly $60 for this bottle of perfume.After spraying, the scent lasts about 30 seconds, then is gone.I've been buying this for my wife for at least 5 years now.Seems like they've changed the formula, probably making a better profit now, at the expense of actually having a scent.Don't waste your money on this unscented alcohol.",1.0
This is my old time go to favorite perfume. I have used this ages ago and forgot about it! It never disappoints and neither did the price on Amazon. I love the scent and it stays forever on me. If I could I would give it 10 stars!,5.0
Don't buy this...what a rip off...it's not the REAL PLEASURES! Fragrance is extremely weak and is gone within minutes after being applied!!,1.0
"I have been ordering from this company. I love this perfume and sticking to it. I have gotten a lot of compliments since I've been using it when it first came out. I love the scent. It's not overwhelming. I love the Estee Lauder Pleasure scents. There's many to choose from. Try one, try them all :)",5.0
"excellent product and fast shipping,recommended.",5.0
i get so many compliments on this perfume. I work in a hospital and even patients that say they are sensitive to perfume say it is very pleasant. it smells clean and fresh but not overpowering! When I run out I always rebuy it. though I  have a number of other perfumes I most often reach for this one.,5.0
"I don't really have anything bad to say.  My wife has been wearing this perfume for years and she loves it.  It never gets old as it keeps a sweet, yet soft, scent to it.  Most perfumes keep a strong scent to it after it dries up, but this one stays soft throughout the day.  There is no excessive overkill of its aura.",5.0
I didn't like it ... this one wears off easy and gave me a headache.,2.0

This particular Bootle the fragrance does not last past 2 hours. This is not the normal for this fragrance. It may be an improperly mixed fragrance to alcohol.,1.0
not sure this is the right product ??,2.0
It smells nice on some people but- it smelt a little too strong and old-ladyish on me. I have high body temperature and that might be the reason. It smells really strong and messy like some stinky flowers.,2.0

"I had been wanting this perfune for the longest time, don't know what took me so long to purchase it but I finally did and I love it! The scent is smooth, clean and pleasant. It would be better for winter but all year-round would work just fine as long as you remember that a little goes a long way...",5.0

This is definitely NOT Eau de Parfume as advertised. The scent is gone a minute after spraying it on. Very disappointing.,1.0
"Estee Lauder has the greatest smelling perfume ever. My husband actually found this deal. I've been wanting Pleasures for quite a while now. We got a 3.4 oz bottle for $54.99 and no shipping cost. That is how much you would pay for a 1.7 oz with a small bottle of lotion at a department store. We jumped on this deal. It got here in a quick manner; smelled great, no box damage, and the bottle was full. It smelled so great, my husband wouldn't leave me alone. The light floral fragrance stays with you all day and you don't have to constantly reapply. I would recommend this product to everyone that loves Estee Lauder's perfumes and the company that I purchased it from and sold it to me at such a great price.",5.0
IT DIDNT SMELL LIKE PLEASURE,2.0
"I love the scent of Estée Lauder ""Pleasures"" and have used it for years now. I love its exquisite and exotic fresh floral fragrance that has a long-lasting effect but not too overpowering. Spray it behind your ears and your wrists after a morning's shower. It will add elegance to your everyday lifestyle. The scent has an amazing staying power that even after a night's shower or bath, it stays on you.So leave a scent of you behind with Estée Lauder ""Pleasures"" - Eau de Parfum Spray.Wholeheartedly recommended.",5.0

"I have used Pleasures for many years. In fact, this is my only favorite. I used to buy this from Bergner’s or Macy’s but tried to buy this here for a bigger bottle and cheaper prize. Well, this is FAKE! The scent does not stay very long!  The original one stays with me all day and i get a lot of compliments! This is a waste of money!!!",1.0
"This is the best smelling perfume ever!  I've worn this for years, as I can't find anything that even compares.  It mixes well with my chemistry, and I notice the beautiful fragrance lingers on my shirts even days after I sprayed it on.  It's not too strong of a scent either, which I like.  It's just right!  AWESOME!",5.0

"From the reviews, I expected a lot from this company and this bottle of perfume. I expected it to be like the one I typically buy from a department store. However, this was not the case. When I removed the cap, there was a faint scent coming from the bottle. When I sprayed it on my skin multiple I could not even smell anything. I am very disappointed with this purchase.",1.0
"I bought this perfume about a year ago, it has a great a unique smell. I loved it, but over time, I gotten sick of it (maybe it's because I used it a bit too much, almost everyday, you see). Anyway, try it before purchase it, I think it's not too expensive, the smell is long-lasting but can be too overwhelming if you spray too much of this killer, haha. Enjoy.",4.0

"This is a great casual, floral perfume. It's clean, fresh, subtle, very feminine and lasts all day without being overpowering. I prefer this perfume for spring and summer. Pleasures has notes of lilies, violets, roses and peonies, with other exotic blossoms and fragrant woods.Perfumes arent just about the scent..but the chemistry of the scent and you. This one works very well with me.",5.0

"Estee Lauder did not have a gourmand/foody fragrance in their lineup during the Flowerbomb/Angel/Pink Sugar trend, so in order to meet the ""me too"" rush, they quickly slapped together this generic fruity gourmand that wants to be unique and distinctive, but it's about 15 years too late. It's a harried, boring composition that wishes it were as delicately delicious as Hanae Mori Butterfly or Dior Hypnotic Poison but fails to come close to either; trying to please everyone by being mediocre.It is a highly forgettable gourmand/floriental that does not linger in one's memory nor draw comments the way an Angel or Flowerbomb would. If you want to be special, buy an *original* fruity gourmand (i.e. Lolita Lempicka, Coco Mademoiselle, Hanae Mori). If you want to be ""me too"", then get Pleasures Delight.",2.0
