"This is one of my 2 favorite women's perfumes!!  This perfume stays longer than any other I have ever worn!  Smelling good is very important to me and has been all my life.  I am very picky about what I wear.  Every time I wear this scent, EVERYONE asks me what I am wearing, including men!  The first time I ever smelled this was in Paris.  I smelled it on another women when boarding a dinner cruise on the Seine with my husband.  I had to ask her what she was wearing.  I bought a small bottle in Paris, the next day before heading home to Colorado.  That bottle lasted me a long time as the scent stays on so well.  Put it on in the morning and you can still smell it when you go to bed that night!  It is amazing!  What is even more amazing is that this bottle was 2.5 oz. versus the 1oz bottle I purchased in Paris, and cost me half as much!  I could not believe it!!!  I had to purchase it as soon as I saw it!!  I LOVE IT!!",5.0

"As soon as my wife put this on, she let me know that it was NOT the same as what we've bought in quality stores. After talking with a couple of friends of mine who work in the perfume department of Carson's and Macy's, they concurred with my wife, and with others who have left comments about online perfume purchases. The bottles and packaging seem right, the labels and seals all seem correct and in place, but the quality inside the bottle is not the same. One of the women told me that in the mall where she works, people will buy perfume at the discount perfumery, and then bring it to their store for a larger refund. She said that the packaging IS DIFFERENT, and they know that it is not the same product that THEY are selling Sadly, until this gets straightened out, I will no longer buy perfumes online. Better to pay more, get the right product, and keep the wife/girlfriend happy, than to save a few bucks, get an inferior product, and strike out.",2.0

"THE BOTTLE CAME IS SLIGHTLY CRACKED,  THE THE IT IS LEAKING...I HAVE TO LAY IT SIDEWARDS SO IT NOT LEAK.. AND THE PERFUME DOES NOT SEEM TO BE GENUINE...IT CLEARLY SMELLS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I BUY AT MACY'S.  I SHOWED IT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AND HAD THEM SMELL THE DIFFERENCE...IT CLEARLY IS AN IMITATION...AND NOT THE GENUINE PERFUME.",2.0
"It was not the real Knowing by Estee Lauder. When the product came in a box, there was no document of product authenticity nor a sales invoice.",1.0
"packaging not sealed, dark color, smells old! stinks! Coworkers agree! Cannot use!!!!  complained to merchant, sent another, not sealed, dark and stinks...sour and old",1.0
This product was no good.  It has soured or is stale and can not be used.  Unfortunately I did not know this as my wife only opened it two days ago.  What do I do to get it replaced as I got rid of the shipping label or can not find it.,1.0

Smell fades quickly. I'm not sure why. Smells great though when first sprayed.,2.0
My wife uses and she likes it so no problems,5.0
"My wife loves this fragrance. I saw the price and thought I could save some money. Unfortunately my wife commented to me after she had used it for awhile and said the fragrance didn't seem to last like the previous, Knowing by Estee Lauder, I had gotten her before. Plus the fact that when we ask if this is the authentic product, we do not get a reply from the vendor certifying it is the real deal. I don't trust this. I will not buy from here again. https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41S-7uTXRyL._SS300_.jpg",1.0
"Bottle leaked and seal broke. Will never, ever buy from this source again.",1.0
scent is not as good as previous bottles I have used,3.0
"Purchased as gift for my mother who has used this perfume for many, many years. She said it wasn't same bottle and didn't smell the same as usual. (She didn't mention until after me asking her about it.) After much research, realized it wasn't authentic (Amazon makes it very difficult to determine the actual company your cologne purchase is made through until after you buy it.)  Purchased another bottle from a reputable department store. Can't return, and lost over $50. but live and learn. Will NEVER again purchase cologne through Amazon or other online only retailers.",1.0
I DO NOT THINK THIS IS AS STRONG AS THE ONES I BUY AT DILLARDS.,2.0
"Knowing is my signature fragrance. All perfumes do not smell the same on all people, it really depends on body chemistry. Every time I apply this perfume, at least one person comments on how beautiful it smells. I've even had men stop me on the street asking for the manufacturer and name as they wanted to get some for someone in their life. I use the fragrance all hours of the day for any function. I'm an older person, but this would be excellent for a women of any age. Give Knowing a try, and I'm sure you'll continue to purchase it time and time again.",5.0
"This is one of the fragrances that I always keep in stock.I don't wear this everyday, only for special occasions.  It is a slightly heavier fragrance so wears well in the evenings and on cooler days or evenings.If you are wanting to attract the attention of men- this fragrance works like a charm.Seriously, I've been at parties or social events and I will have men following me around the room to ask me what I am wearing, or they will comment ""you smell so good, I had to ask you what you are wearing where I can buy this for my wife/girl friend"".This is a heavier fragrance and was created in the late 80's when a number of other fragrances were a little more heavy.  This would be an ""alpha female scent"", it definitely ""announces itself"" when you are wearing it.  You need to be confident enough to pull this one off.  It is also kind of one of those fragrances that wears well with maturity.  I don't see this fragrance being worn by a woman who lacks confidence, it is a fragrance that definitely speaks volumes and has the air about it that whomever wears this, has a certain level of sophistication.  It is almost like wearing a certain outfit or shoes-- if it isn't a good ""fit"" for the person wearing it, it will come off as if the woman is trying to wear her mothers (or others) clothing or shoes.  (It is certainly NOT for a woman who wants to play the role of a wall flower).It is sophisticated, sensual, sexy, classic, classy, and has a note and tone to it that commands respect.  It is definitely an upper end fragrance, the notes in this particular fragrance are very RICH and may be an acquired taste for a lot of people.  You will never have someone mistake this fragrance for a drug store or cheap brand.  It is highly sophisticated.  Upper Crust.I wear this for special occasions.  It definitely draws response from men, so is a fragrance that I am careful to wear only when I want to draw that type of attention.It is also a great fragrance for professional women, but will be too over powering if you have an office cramped tightly with a lot of people who are sensitive to stronger perfumes.  This fragrance requires ""breathing room""- I would think twice about wearing this to a sporting event, movie, or theater performance-- simply because someone near you may feel that this is overwhelming to sit for long periods of time.This wears well and has long durability.  It is a fragrance that I would apply at least 30 minutes (or more) before stepping out --  it goes on very strong .  A little of this goes a LONG Way.  Use sparingly... (you don't want to knock people out).  It is wayyyyy too heavy for the gym or sporting events, so I'm careful not to wear this when I am planning to go to the gym later that day/evening.I love this fragrance.  It is one of my very favorites.  As a perfume creator, Estee Lauder had a great ""nose"" - this is truly one of her best and finest creations!",5.0
"I've worn this perfume for at least 25 years and still love it.  It works well with my body chemistry, and smells exactly the same on me as in the bottle.  I've gotten compliments over the years from both men and women, various ethnicities & nationalities.",5.0
"Wish I could get a hold of the person I bought this from. I bought it a couple of months ago....and just took it out of the box. Still had a bottle I was finishing. I have bought this product off Amazon before. I am so unsatisfied with this bottle. I don't know what the problem is....but it is not the knowing I have bought in the past. Has very little smell, and doesn't last 30 minutes. The real Knowing will smell great and last for hours...as you can still smell it the next day on your clothes. I am so disappointed. I feel Like I was given fake perfume!!!!!",1.0
"Perfume doesn't like me, it doesn't ""stick"" for any length of time.  This does.  AND I have received compliments when wearing this.  I have never received a compliment on a fragrance before.  When you wear a fragrance, it will get on your clothes.  The smell that lingers will begin to smell ""stale"" and sometimes you can't wash it away.  Gratefully, I haven't had this problem.",5.0
"Years ago I was driving through the hills of PA, in the snow, with tired child and 3 hours to go.Stopped at creepy only place open truck stop for gas. Pum ped the gas, fumbled with stroller and kidto go inside to pay for the petrol. Felt this enormous truckers eyes boring through me, too tired to give a rip.As he followed me outside, I started worrying. Stopped and made a production about getting my cel phone out.Made it to the car, got kid in car seat, thought about dumping the stroller. He appeared by my window, banged on the glass and said ""I was standing behind you in line. I have to know what perfume you are wearing, it made me feel great and my wife will love it."" Felt like an ass as I wrote down ""Knowing."" This fragrance has illicited similar responses for over 20 years.  Please help me find powder refills!",5.0
I have been buying knowing for the last 30 years from dept stores. I tried this one from amazon and it is not the same color is different and the smell is different. It can't be the original authentic Knowing that I usually buy. Will stick to dept stores for purchasing Knowing.,2.0
"I've never ordered perfume without knowing the scent but I trusted customer reviews;  I was not disappointed!  It arrived in a timely manner and of course, I applied some to my wrists.  About 7hrs later, I could still smell it and it seemed quite powerful at first but once on, it mellowed to a perfect scent.  I do believe I will keep this as one of my favorites!",5.0
"So awesome y'all its the original!!!... I read the reviews some were negative I almost didn't order it but I took the chances and its, the smell its beautiful, the bottle, even the box are the same if you were it bought it from a department store. Price at department store $85, here $48",5.0

"My Mom loves this perfume, and buying it this way means I don't have to drive half an hour to the mall, walk through a huge department store, and then try to flag down a salesperson who is going to try and sell me other products.",5.0
Love this fragrance!,5.0
"A very strong perfume, this one lasts a long time because the tiniest of little sprays will stay with you all day long. For me, this one has a decay rate of about 24 hours, meaning I don't need more all day, and the fragrance, while a bit sharp initially, softens into a nice presence.",5.0
"Knowing was my beloved Grandmother's signature sent. Long after my Grandfather had lost his sense of smell due to a stroke, he continued buying her Knowing every year for Christmas. My Grandma passed her love of Knowing on to me. Although my husband isn't a fan, and I don't normally wear such strong scents, I will always have Knowing in my collection in honor of my precious Grandparents. It is a classy scent for a very confident and classy lady.",5.0
"Bought this for my mom, it's her favorite fragrance. I shopped all over the internet and this was the best deal.  A great price and quick shipping.  Highly recommend!",5.0
"Was so happy to see the Amazon carried Knowing, saved me from going to the big dept. store. Been wearing Knowing for over 20 years now.  Have tried other fragrances but never get the compliments I get when I wear Knowing and the scent lasts a really long time.",5.0
The smell of Knowing is so elegant and exquisite. I get compliments all the time. It makes me feel beautiful and sexy.,5.0
My absolute favorite. I get lots of compliments when I wear it and even men ask me for the name of the scent.,5.0
I'm embarrassed to say I have worn only this fragrance for 33 years. I have just never found anything I like as well. And even after all these years I'll have people stop me to ask what fragrance I'm wearing - which is exactly what I did to find it for myself all those years ago.,5.0
I have been wearing KNOWING for many years and I still receive many compliments - not overpowering or sweet - I hope it is never discontinued,5.0
"Very pleasant fragrance, strong, evening wear the best. Why the best fragrances , they stop making, does not make sense",5.0
"This (in my humble opinion) is the Cadillac of ladies perfumes, bar none!  I get this perfume for my mother; often giving it to her for her birthday and/or Christmas.  Its soft distinctive aroma exudes class and sophistication.  When my mother wears it, the whole house seems like someone brought in a huge boucay of flowers.  It is simply heaven.  If you want to impress a lady friend; you couldn't ask for a better idea!",5.0
I have used this for years and still love it!  Tried other fragrances and always come back to Knowing! Love it!,5.0
"People (men) either love this scent or hate it. My ex-husband hated it. I LOVE it!  I ALWAYS get compliments and have had many people ask me what I'm wearing over the past 15 years I've worn Knowing. I guess I can say the strangest compliment I ever got was when I walked past a kid a basketball game and he said,  ""what's that perfume? It's mesmerizing! """,5.0
"""Knowing"" by Estee Lauder has been my signature perfume for many years. It is sensual without being overbearing and it makes me feel pleasant and alluring. Several years ago I was working in the expediting office of a large company. Next door was the receving dept where a young man in his late teens worked. He made it a habit to stop by to say hello every morning. When I told him how nice it was for him to come by every morning, He said, ""Oh, that's o.k. I like stopping by to see you; you smell just like my grandma."" So much for being 'alluring.' Wouldn't you KNOW it...his grandma and I both use Knowing by Estee Lauder.  Knowing is timeless.",5.0
Very fresh fragrance and very sensual.  I like it very much and get many questions as to what is that?  It is different!,5.0
"Knowing is the perfect name for this classy scent. It's got crisp clean top notes, but mellows out to a very lingering sensual fragrance.  A little Knowing goes a long way. It's definitely not for daytime, but as an evening fragrance, it's perfect. Though it's pricey, a bottle will last you longer than many other scents. In fact, the lotion alone, lingers on the skin for hours.  This is Estee Lauders best scent in the evening line of fragrances, and on the right woman, it's simply unforgettable.",5.0
I LOVE this perfume.  I've been wearing this for almost 30 years!!,5.0
"I have worn this fragrance for years and I just can't find anything I like better.  Complete strangers will come up to me and say: ""You smell good! What are you wearing?""",5.0
"I received this product and found it not to be the same as what I am use to. The smell was not the same and it does not stay with me for the entire day like I am use to. I was bummed because it would have been a good deal with the price that is posted. I have used knowing for fifteen years . The reason I love it is because I have a really hard time wearing most scents but with knowing people are always telling me how nice I smell.Sorry it didn't, work for me",1.0
"I was introduced to Knowing 20 or 30 years ago when abroad, and it continues to me one of my and a friend's favorite scent.  It's great that it's still available online, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a fragrance that is enduring, pleasing, not too floral or spicy, and very feminine.",5.0
I ordered this because I checked online at tip 10 perfumes and this was number 2. It smells like something a much older person would use. Don't take that the wrong way. I don't like it for me,1.0
"I used Estee for years and still claim it as a favorite of mine, but Knowing has gotten me more compliments as to ""Hmmm what is that your wearing, it smells wonderful""  Now I am a knowing wearer because I also like its wondrous scent!",5.0
"Don't know much about women's perfumes, but my Mom loved it as a gift for Mother's day.",5.0
i have used knowing for a long time. Could not find in most stores so i started looking on line and found it. I love it and my husband love it too. I wish it could be put back on stores shelves again. People always ask me what is that your wearing?  it smell so good. I is knowing!!!!!!!!!!,5.0
"Started using this perfume from the time Estee Lauder introduced it and have never used any other perfume since.  But what surprises me the most is the number of women (and men) that comment on how good it smells!!  I have been a walking talking ad for Estee Lauder Knowing for manu years now!  Love the perfume!  Thanks, Estee Lauder for a beautiful, sensuous perfume.  Please don't ever discontinue it!And thanks Amazon.com for stocking it at prices better than the local department stores.",5.0
I't the ONLY  Perfume my wife uses.,5.0
this is a verry good value for this product compaired to the higher end stores where you usually have to get the estee lauder products I would like to see a bigger variety in complete gift baskets  and more of this collections,5.0
I first used KNOWING in college and the scent stayed in my memory. It is still a wonderful feminine scent that is not overwhelming but lingers with you. Great as a signature scent!,5.0
"In 1990 my husband bought me Knowing for my birthday.  I have worn it every day since.  I get many many compliments when I wear it, day and night.  I keep thinking I should change to another scent, but I just can not make the change.  What will I do if they discontinue Knowing?",5.0
I got this on Amazon for my mother for cheaper than retail.  She was extremly happy with the parfum and how it smelled.,4.0
