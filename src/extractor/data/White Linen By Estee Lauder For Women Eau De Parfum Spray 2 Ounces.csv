"For  over 20 years, White Linen has always been my favorite fragrance.  The company changed the name, some time ago, and was very hard to find the original.  The new perfume is Pure White Linen.  This aroma was not the same on me as the original.  Was so happy to be able to find my favorite at Amazon.",5.0
Wife loves it.  Has used it before so nothing new for her.  Smells good highly recommended product.  Probably priced quivalent for what it is.,5.0
A beautiful fragrance which women real appeal towards.,5.0
"I have been wearing Whitle Linen for over 10 years.  This perfume has endured because it has such an attractive scent--so clean and fresh!  People who are familiar with it always seem to comment  ""Oh, you're wearing While Linen, I just love the way it smells"".  What better endorsement can you get?  Yeah, it's an oldie but a really GREAT oldie!!",5.0
"I have been wearing this for years and years and years.  Nothing else will do.  Now, since I am on Social Security; I can't just buy it when I want.  The kids had been giving this to me for Christmas and birthdays; but not the two last years.  I was so happy to see that Amazon carried it and the price that was charged.  I couldn't be happier!!",5.0
"This is the original perfume, it's crazy nice",5.0
I cannot find this in the store anymore.  But my mom kept telling me how she loves White Linen.  I found this to be the best price.  It was delivered quickly and in great shape.,5.0
I have been wearing this fragrance in the summer months for about 30 years and it's still going strong.  Excellent transaction.  A+++++++++++++++++++++++++,5.0

Estee Lauder is the primary cosmetic line us middle class American can access and enjoy with out spending a fortune.  Estee is all American and all class,5.0
"This is a fantastic perfume. It reminds me the crispiness of Chanel 22 minus an astronomical price tag. This is also a true hidden treasure. While doing a research of Estee Lauder perfumes, I found out that the company does not spend a ton of money on advertising, leaving many of their wonderful creations from public eye. These perfumes are highly rated by the professional perfume reviewers. Since the prices are affordable, there is no issue with knock-offs as well. Estee Lauder has also not reformulated the original formula of White Linen, a common practice elsewhere that usually bring sub-quality results. This is a truly remarkable perfume worthy of admiration.",5.0
"I purchased this for my mom. She really REALLY has been wanting some so it was a great b-day present. The problem is that it has no stem. So, to get the perfume out or put a stem you would have to literally break the seal on top that seems to be welded on. The other issue is that Amazon doesn't allow returns on things like this. Don't buy from this company. What a joke.",1.0
I have been looking for a sophisticated yet light fragrance for sometime. I wanted a perfume that would smell fresh and clean without announcing my prescence before I entered the room. I believe I have found it! This has a lasting scent. Would recommend.,4.0
"I love Estee fragrances because they last a long time.  If I didn't know better, I would swear this was a fake.  Completely different than previous purchases of this product.",2.0
Smelled like it was an older product.  Not like the one it replaced.  Might be from older out dated stock.  I ordered 2 of them and gave one as a gift.  My friend noticed the difference right away.  Very disappointed.  Won't order again.,1.0
"This is one of those oldie but goodie Estee Lauder fragrances (created in 1978).  Yes, it smells a bit dated today but it is still good.  It truly does have that clean-clothes-hanging-in-the-sunshine scent.  It is not a sexy, vampish perfume but more a girl next door/mom scent.  Nothing dirty or carnal here.It has that bright aldehyde scent that lingers with a bit of lemony/flowery scent which gives it that clean linen note.  The flowers are not bold, just gentle.  I smell a bit of rose, hyacinth, lily of the valley and jasmine.  Honey, cedar & sandalwood give it some depth.This is one those scents I rarely wear but sometimes I just want familiarity & easy & this one works.Make sure you buy from a reputable seller; there are many fakes out there.  I always look for ""Ships From & Sold By Amazon"" when buying here.",4.0
I've been wearing White Linen for years and was so happy to see that Amazon was carrying it at the low price that was advertised. I was out of my favorite perfume and couldn't find it anywhere until someone suggested Amazon so I was ecstatic. I hope you continue to carry this same perfume for many years to come. I can't tell you the compliments that I've received over the years on this particular perfume and I'm so happy that I have it again. It's not overpowering just gentle soft and spring-like and you can wear it all year.,5.0
Great product and costs so much less than purchasing from the local chain store. My wife loves it. Have purchased many times from this source.,5.0
"I have been using this cologne since it first came out.  It's just so great that I could bathe in it!  Nothing else I have found comes close to how great it is for me.  All cologne smells different on each person, but if subtle scents with a hint of citrus works for you this may be the one!",5.0
"I 've used  White Linen for more than thirty years. I loved it. It has been my signature fragrance. I finished my last bottle last week and yesterday I opened the new one that I purchased in July through Amazon. It doesn't smell right! Has the formula changed?I completely understand that I missed the opportunity to return this product,  but I just wanted to know if something in this product has changed for future reference.Thank you.",3.0
This smelled so old!,1.0
"This particular bottle I purchased in May 2017, is a knock off; the fragrance doesn't last 3 minutes and the scent is weak.  It just took me a while to change my original review.",1.0
Arrived on time & just as described. It's the real thing for a pretty good price!,5.0
It's a nice clean scent.  A little goes a long way and the scent lasts a long time.  This could be used all year long with no fear that it is too heavy for summer or too light for winter.,5.0
No stars Is better.  I have used white linen for  over 30  years something is seriously wrong here the box and bottle look the same but the nice clean fragrance is no where to be found. This is a rip off. I am going to contact  Estee Lauder for an explanation if you are a new user or like me an old timer I would  . seriously think long and hard before purchasing this one.,1.0
Luv it!  One spray is enough;  more than one spray would make it too strong.,5.0
"I've been wearing White Linen for more than 20 years. It and Joy By Jean Patou For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5 Ounces were the first ""grown up"" perfumes I wore. As a teen (in the 80s!) I wore the ubiquitous Loves Baby Soft By Mem For Women. Cologne Spray 1.75-Ounce and Love's Fresh Lemon by Dana for Women 1.5 oz Body Mist. (Hmmm...that's the first time I've thought about them for years. They would make a nice gift for my nieces and any young teens you know!) ""Grown up"" perfumes (like my mom' signature scent, Youth Dew by Estee Lauder for Women - 2.2 Ounce EDP Spray) felt too heavy for me at that time. Since then, I do wear Youth Dew and also Chanel No 5 Women, 3.4oz / 100ml EDP, SPRAY, NEW & SEALED in the winter, but haven't left White Linen behind!White Linen is a blend of fresh florals including jasmine, rose, berry, moss and amber. I first drawn to it for its fresh scent. It reminds me of some unnamed scented soap. Just so clean and fresh and breezy.I think it's a better scent for the warm weather months.",5.0
"This is ""my fragrance"" and has been for almost 40 years!  This is the best price anywhere!",5.0
I love Estee Lauder and White Linen is one of the best fragrances.,5.0
i like the fragrance very much i wish it would stay on longer,4.0
I tried this product in store but it was way too expensive so I decided to get it from Amazon. There were so many positive reviews so I got it but I don't like it now as much as I did like it in store. It feels somewhat heavy and wouldn't last for more than 3-4 hours.,3.0
Not sure but I think the shelf life has expired. The scent does not last like it should. This is the first time I have ever had this happen.,1.0
I don't care for this scent... I had thought it was more like the white shoulders scent. it is NOT.,3.0
Great buy for size and Estee Lauder perfumes are lasting ones,5.0
"Very different scent from what I tested in the department store - less floral, more metallic. Disappointing.",1.0
"This a perfume that I have been wearing for 20 years.  I recently tried another Estee Lauder but went back to this one.  By the way, the service from Amazon was excellent.",5.0
Product smelled nothing like the fragrance should. It smelled very old. Tried to return and returns were not accepted so straight to the trash it went.,1.0
"Very nice smell, is not strong or offensive.  I can't tell you how it smells, other than it is light and yet smells good on.",5.0
"Bought this as a gift for my mother, her lifelong favourite perfume.  She says the scent is so weak that it must have been a counterfeit and urged me not to buy online again..",1.0
This fragrance smelt like a bush bug and it is very strong. I actually bought it for my mom who loves it but i cannot take the scent and i love loud perfumes.,2.0
I have bought white linen before and loved it.This one the scent doesn't last. Is this old perfume?,2.0
"This is not authentic White Linen by Estée Lauder. Period.  I have worn real WL for over 25 years, bought from better department stores, so I know very well  what the real thing smells like.  Now I find out this is a non-returnable item ? I smell a rat.....",1.0
Wife loves it and so do I.  Sometimes I will walk behind her just to pick up the scent.  Kinda long lasting also.  Highly recommend.,5.0
"I have used this perfume for many years, since the 80s, I always enjoy it every time I put it on.",5.0
"A favorite of mine for years.  A light, clean scent.  Always receive compliments on it.",5.0
I'm afraid I'm not terribly adventurous when it comes to perfume as I find so many fragrances too heavy.  I have used White Linen for years and years!!  I HAVE tried others but always come back to White Linen.  It's light and fresh and I LOVE IT!!!!,5.0
Not the best I've ever used defiantly not strong enough in the nineties this would last in my clothes for weeks,3.0
"I love many of Estee Lauder's older scents. White Linen is light, but endures a long time.",5.0
Very pleased with this purchase. It arrived on time. Very nice scent and long lasting.,5.0
I have been buying this perfume for my wife for nearly 30 years. Still my hands down favorite for her and she loves it as well.,5.0

"The delivery was Amazon's usual excellent - however the White Linen is not the correct fragrance and it does not have the lasting ability of the original.  I have used White Linen almost exclusively for the last 30 years.  I have some of the last bottle I used so am able to do a real comparison.  This new one is much ""heavier"".  I just learned not to buy it without being able to try it - unfortunately.",2.0

I have worn this fragrance in the past many times.  This time the smell is totally different.  Not sure if my body chemistry has changed or if the spray is old and or outdated.  Will have to compare with Macy's fragrance counter.,2.0
"she smells very fresh and sexy, highly recommend this product and price is very good also, a great gift for any occasion",5.0
it smells old or like it has been in the sun- i know what damaged perfume smells like having had enough of it!,2.0
I used White Linen several years ago and now I still like it a lot.  I'm glad I can get it from Amazon.,4.0
"I purchased this produce hoping for a ""clean and fresh"" scent. This not clean smelling nor fresh. It has a very strong perfumy scent which is not what I was looking for. It's even worse that I can't return this item. Very dissapinted.",1.0
