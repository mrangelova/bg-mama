I have fallen in love with this scent!! I smelt it at Ulta and I immediately wanted to bathe in it. lol. I rushed to amazon to order it within the hour. I get soooo many compliments on it. This scent is subtle yet packs a punch; it lasts on me for quite a while. I will be getting this in a travel size because I always want to have it on me. Definitely my new favorite!,5.0
"What an incredible scent, its like a fresh tropical breeze mixed with fresh cotton and a hint of coconut. I love this as a daytime perfume because it is more versatile than my usual favorite (Gucci Guilty) which I sometimes feel is a little more for evenings/winter/romantic night out. This scent is sophisticated but great for the summer heat too, everyday wear and especially nice for vacations. (Try EL's Bronze Goddess for you beach days, wonderful paring)",5.0
This is one of my favorite scents. I get SO many compliments when I wear it. I personally think the scent is just the right strength. Not too much and not too little. It lasts throughout the day and can be a great day to night wear perfume.,5.0

"When I first smelled this scent from an insert in a magazine, I immediately fell in love with it.  I love this scent.  It's very sensuous and sexy and soft.  The lotion compliments it or can be worn alone.  I knew it was a hit when I was outside Wet Willie's and a man walked up to me and complimented me several times about the sexy scent.  It was such a nice surprise to hear a studly man loved the scent as well.  Ladies, this is a must have.",5.0

Should have tried in store before purchased. My fault. Several Reviews  said smelled like coconut: not the coconuts I have smelled. Disappointed. Wanted a coconut scent. Delivery was excellent. One for the garbage.,1.0
I smell like a little old lady.,2.0
"I love this perfume.  I first got it as a gift - which always makes me nervous as I react to certain perfumes - and not in a good way.  This was perfect.  Very light, yet scent seems to last.  Get many compliments when wearing it.  I purchased the same size from Bloomingdale's - $$$$.  I decided to look on Amazon - exact same perfume - and same scent as in my old bottle.  Very pleased.",5.0

"My husband and I went perfume shopping (his idea) and tried every perfume in the department store. Finally ended up at the EstÃ©e Lauder counter, and immediately fell in love with this fragrance. The name is accurate... clean, soft  (nude) and sooo sensuous... If you are looking for something your coworkers and friends will smell and comment on, this isn't it... this is subtle and comes to life in the warm areas... I love it!!!! So does he!!! Worth the price...and I don't pay extra for anything! ðŸ’ž",5.0

This fragrance is very different than any other fragrance I've tried. It is perfect for summer because it has almost a beachy scent. It is neither floral nor fruity. It's very different but also very lovely. Lasting power is great.,5.0
