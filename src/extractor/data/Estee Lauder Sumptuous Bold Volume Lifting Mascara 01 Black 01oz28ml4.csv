"I LOVE this mascara! It's seriously one of my favorites. However, it is not waterproof. This doesn't say whether it is or not, but it isn't. Make sure you aren't wearing it anywhere you may get teary-eyed.",5.0
"I like this product, but unfortunately the items I received were dry and not useable.",2.0
"I am in lose with the Mascara! I think that my favorite thing is that it is water resistant, instead of waterproof! I also have severe allergies, and it does not both my eyes, or flake off! I have ordered these 4 little tubes twice, and the first set lasted for almost a full year! I like the convince of the smaller tubes to be honest, and I will more than likely order some more for stocking stuffers!",5.0
This is normally a great mascara that offers some flexibility on the lashes.  This particular order is a bit rigid so maybe it is an old batch.,4.0
"My favorite mascara, goes on flawless for full, non-clumping lashes that last all day. It doesn't run down your face it it gets splashed with water either which is nice! Does wash off easily in the shower or with wipes",5.0
Fantastic mascara. I actually like the trial size- get to discard and go fresh more often.,5.0
"i am post menopausal lady with thinning lashes, this mascara is great, it makes my lashes look full, without clumps of mascara.  i dont even have to comb through them after i apply.",5.0
"I love the fact that it comes in several tubes.  A small tube lasts just as long as a large tube, and you have three or four as a rule.  The product is very good quality, doesn't clump like drug store brands.  Goes on smooth and lasts all day.",5.0
Mascara is dry and not impressed. Very disappointed.,1.0
I have been using this mascara for 35 years!,5.0
"Great mascara, and since I don't use much often, the trial sizes are a great fit for me.  That plus the fact I have had ""pink-eye"" 7 times in a year....thought it best to change out mascara often.",5.0
"Sucks! Really sucks, I don't know if is original, but don't look like because Estee Lauder have really good products, but this in special, sucks!",1.0
Then again I love Estee Lauder!,5.0
love this mascara its my fav!,5.0
"I purchased these as AMAZON PRIME item, so felt secure in my order. These showed up in a zip-lock baggie, were not the same as the picture (blue & gold tubes) & seemed a little dusty. Presentation made me feel a little iffy about using these & where they came from. Would rather spent more $ & bought a 100% new bottle straight from Estee Lauder.",3.0
"The mascara appears fresh, and I like the small containers (typically, I need to throw my mascara out before it's used up).  I will buy these again.",5.0

"Like samples from an Estee Lauder gift bag, which are free. Nothing special. I would not recommend buying them. They are definitely not ""sumptuous"" as advertised.",1.0
My mom and I adore these. My mom uses a lot of creams and says this is the only mascara that doesnt rub off,5.0
Best mascara ever!  Lengthens and adds volume!,5.0
Excellent product!,5.0
They were all dry and did not work. I just wasted money.,1.0
"Old, flaky. Not standard.",1.0
Love this mascara. You can really tell it's high quality. It's the first non-drug store brand I've used and it makes me lashes much longer and fuller and for longer than other mascaras.,5.0
"Works well, need to put on a couple coats though.",4.0
"The product that came was actually in the sample size 'blue' color, not white as the picture.  Other than that I am VERY happy with this purchase!",5.0
"Given to my wife as a Christmas present, she is very happy with this and a number of other Estee Lauder products.",5.0
It does not cause irritation (I have problems with flakes getting in my eyes with other mascaras) but it does run on me and I end up with raccoon eyes by midday.,3.0
"My wife gives it 5 stars. She says that unlike other mascara, it doesn't smear or leave little black dots under your eyes after a period of wear.",5.0
It's a little on the dry side so I needed to apply it twice to get a good length but this product lasts w/o smearing.,4.0
Started using this mascara about 3 years ago and will never use another! This mascara makes your lashes look FABULOUS!!,5.0
Pretty good! Not the absolute best but this is like my 3rd favorite mascara and I've used a million different ones! :),4.0

"Best Mascara ever!  It only takes two coats to make my eyelashes look fabulous! I have oily skin, so I usually get the black streaks on my eyelids by the afternoon, but not with this.  It stays all day, but is easy to remove with water or make-up removal wipes.",5.0
This is a great mascara from Estee Lauder. It makes my lashes look long and thick without overclumping. It lasts all day and does not end up on my cheek by the end of the day. It rinses off easily with soap and water (though I do sometimes have to help the process along with some makeup remover). I also like that you can buy it in small containers like this so that the tube doesn't dry out.,5.0
Should have known this was no deal.  All of the 4 tubes are dry. Had to add saline to them.  They are old.  They will work in a pinch but will not buy them again.  You get what you pay for. Lesson learned.,3.0
"I prefer the Lancome Definicils over this one.  But I couldn't find the Definicils at a price I was willing to pay and the price on this was very reasonable.  It is easy to wash off with just soap and water, need to put more time into really getting the volume you want, that is why I like the Definicils, you don't have to spend that much time on it to get the look you need in half the time.  But this is second best to Lancome.  Over all it is a nice product.",4.0
"Well priced for what you get!  I am experimenting with sample sizes in multiples bc EVERY mascara I try no matter how expensive, quickly becomes dried out/clumpy/deteriorated.  I have tried another brand in a sample size of 3 which seems to provide more dramatic coverage with less reps,but clumps earlier.  So now trying to decide if I want to go back to that one. I have limited time for my makeup routine, so I think I may go in that direction.  Overall, I would say, give this one a try and see what you think! IMHO it is def worth a try and much better than trying expensive mascaras that may last just as long as one or two of these sample sizes!",3.0
do not recommend,2.0
Love this!,5.0
Love it ! Will order again soon,5.0
"These were professionally wrapped and labeled, and from what I can tell they have not expired. I hate when you buy mascara at the pharmacy and it is all dried out or smells outdated! These were perfect and I highly recommend. You only need two coats for full lashes.",5.0
"I like Estee Lauder mascara and since I don't wear makeup every day, I often feel I need to throw out the full size ones before they are used up.  So I really love being able to get these sample sizes.  Also good value for money.",5.0
"I am very impressed with this lash-separating, volume producing mascara.  I have purchased this quartet twice over already and will stick with them.",5.0
"Estee Lauder Sumptuous Bold Volume Lifting Mascara was the first Estee Lauder beauty product that I have used. And I am here to report that I was 100 % satisfied with this mascare. I typically only purchase drug store brands but because of the price I felt okay with buying this. The wand is thick and catches all of my lashes , one coat is plenty and even in the .1oz I was able to make it last for the three months of summer.",4.0
"I love this mascara! Have been using Estee Lauder mascara for years. It produces long lush lashes which is a must. But I really like the fact that I don't have to use make-up remover to remove it, I just use my gentle facial cleanser every night.",5.0
"Mascara is dried out, would not buy again.",1.0
Love this mascara! My aunt gives these to me whenever she gets them in the mail as free samples and they last a long time for sample sizes. Highly recommended.,5.0
