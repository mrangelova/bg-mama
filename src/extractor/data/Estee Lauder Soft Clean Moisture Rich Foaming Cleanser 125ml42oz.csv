What I really love about  this product is that a little goes a long way. You just have to squeeze a press size amount maybe even smaller in your wet hands and rub and you get a lot of suds from it. I like how it leaves a clean feeling on your face and doesn't really make your face dry like those other washes.,5.0
"Can't say enough about how i love this product! It feels awesome on my skin without leaving it dry after washing with it. Meaning it is very moisturizing and doesn't crack my face off after i am done washing it off. My skin is smooth, happy and supple. I will def be buying it again when i am through with this bottle.",5.0

"Everything I love goes off the market.  This was the best cleaning product for the face and they changed the formula and it's in a blue tub.  New and improved, NOT!!  I was glad to find these on Amazon.  You only need a little dab and it would foam, just enough.  I don't know why Estee thought it necessary to change something that worked so well.  They should have added a new line, not taken this one off!",5.0
I have been using this product for years. It is really good for dry skin. It makes my skin very fresh.,5.0
I like to use this cleanser but this was expensive than it is sold in the mall. I did not compare the price when I purchase... I am buying next products thru estee lauder online shop.,2.0
It is great for cleaning. I love this product. Have been using for years. Must try it is good for all skin types. Highly recommend this.,5.0
Love everything about this product....starting with the wonderful fragrance to the clean results when finished.  Have been using it for years.,5.0
Best face wash I have used. Got as a gift and have been using ever since for years. you only have to use a tiny bit because it foams up. literally just a tiny amount. mine lasts for months and months almost a year! I have pretty easy skin but can break out with the wrong product. This never makes me break out. It has very fine exfoliate-rs. Almost unnoticeable.,5.0
This cleanser does a good job removing makeup and it doesn't leave your face dry. I don't like the smell of it though and be careful not to get it in your eyes because it hurts! Usually the gentle cleansers I've used don't burn your eyes.,4.0
It is like an older product that I don't think they carry anymore but slays liked this.,5.0
I love this cleansing cream !  Very rich.  You only use a small amount ...so it lasts forever.  And the fragrance is awesome.  Have been using the resilience lift line of EL for years....and not only does it do wonders for this tired old face...but I never get tired of the light fresh  scent.,5.0
Never disappointed with this product.  Always makes my face feel moisturized after washing my makeup off. As a middle aged woman I appreciate a product that does NOT make me feel dried out.,5.0
"Been using this for years, it's an excellent foaming face cleaner that leaves you skin feeling fantastic. Use warm water to open and cleanse your pores, then a final rinse with cold water to close your pores, and tighten your skin.. makes you skin look and feel fabulous!",5.0
I got a 1.7 fluid oz tube of this as a part of an Estee Lauder gift set.  The product comes out as a very thick pearly paste.  Keep in mind- very little of it goes a long way.  It foams up very nicely and imparts a very pleasant delicate scent.  The product rinses off very cleanly and leaves no feeling of residue. My face feels so fresh and clean and I feel like I just treated my face to a mini-spa- in just a few minutes!  I say this is worth the higher price tag because you need to use so little of it.  I will continue using this since I love washing my face with it so much.,5.0
I went shopping yesterday for a new cleanser and thought I'd try this one. I could not have imagined at the time what a good decision it turned out to be. This feels absolutely amazing on your face - it truly is soft and rich and foaming and just lovely. I recommend this 1 million percent and will use it from here on out.,5.0
"It was OLD and expired! It's supposed to be white and creamy, it's was yellow and chunky! Super super disappointed. Will not purchase again. I'll try's and upload a pic as soon as I'm home.",1.0
"I love everything about this product! It's great that you only use very little because it foams up a lot. I use it with my clarisonic and I really like it!! Since you only need to use very little at a time (half of a pea size) I had the same tube for about a year or maybe more! But I do switch to my other Olay face wash sometimes, not a much though. I like the way it smells, it's fresh and clean and after I wash my face it feels very clean.",5.0
"This is a great facial cleanser for someone with normal to dry skin. It is thick and creamy, almost like a lotion. I use this with my clarisonic mia morning and night and my face is always squeaky clean afterwards. It does have a fragrance, so be aware of that if you are someone that is sensitive to scents (I personally love it). I follow up with the Soft Clean toner and I really have been enjoying the combo.",5.0
OMG this product is super good it doesn't just make your face super silky smooth it also makes your pimples and acne disappear you have to use it for a while and it feels weird putting it on but its super good you should wash your face put it on leave it on for 20 minutes or an hour and then wash it out it also to me makes your face look younger and baby soft,5.0
"A girlfriend gave me a tube if this in a present last year and I finally used it all and have just ordered another two tubes, your skin feels really lovely after using itYou definitely only need a small amount so it goes a long way",5.0
